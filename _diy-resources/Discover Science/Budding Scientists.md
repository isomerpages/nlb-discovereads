<p>Time is an interesting phenomenon. It is untouchable, invisible and yet it is always around us. Let’s have some fun learning about the concept of time and routine with the use of clocks!</p>
	
<h4>LET'S SING</h4>
<h5>Tuning-in Song: Hickory Dickory Dock</h5>
<p>A tuning-in song is a simple, yet important component to include when introducing children to new concepts, especially abstract ones. It acts like a fun hook and energises them for the actual learning activity later.</p>

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<p>The repetitive nature of the song helps with pattern recognition and rhythm synchronisation. Children can understand and expect the changes in the structure of the song, which develops their mathematical awareness. Encourage your child to clap along with the striking of the clock. E.g. clap once when the clock strikes One, twice when the clock strikes Two etc.</p>
	
<h4>LET'S READ!</h4>

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4>
<p>Asking open-ended questions during storytelling is an important and engaging way to guide a child’s exploration, critical and creative thinking through reading.</p>

<h4>LET'S CRAFT!</h4>
<h5>Crafting your own Clock!</h5>
<img src="/images/ClockCraft.jpg" style="width:300px; text-align:left;">

<p>Children can try making their own clock so that they can get familiar with the different parts of the clock and their functions. In time, they can learn about the values of seconds, minutes, and hours as well as other instruments that tell time.</p>
<p>This crafting activity is simple and requires materials that can be found around the house. Download and print out the templates here to help you!</p>

[Template for Clock Crafting Activity](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/TemplateforClockCraftingActivity.pdf)

<h5>Instructions</h5>
<p>1. Cut out a circle from felt board or drawing block, roughly 15cm in diameter for the clock face.</p>
<p>2. Cut out the circles and clock hands from the template prepared.</p>
<p>3. Write down the numbers "1" to "12" on each of the circles. Have your child count along as you this. Have your child count along as you do this.</p> 
<p>4. Using a paper fastener, fasten all three of the clock hands to the face and ta-da! You have your very own wonderful time teller!</p>
<h4>LET'S INVESTIGATE!</h4>
<h5>Learning with your Handmade Clock</h5>
<p>We just made a very wonderful Time Teller! Time for us to use it to teach our children a few key concepts about time.</p> 
<br>
<img src="/images/HoursandMinutes.png" style="width:600px; text-align:left;">
<p>Download the printable below and paste it up somewhere so your child will always remember the values of hours and minutes.</p>

<h4>LET'S PLAY!</h4> 
<p>Play is a great way to get children excited about learning and discovering new concepts.</p> 
<p>Download and print out the resources below for activities that you can do with your child to help them learn the wonders of routines.</p>
<p>The first activity we have will teach your child the different times of the day; i.e. morning, afternoon, evening and night as well as the activities we should be doing during these times. Print these out and play a fun matching game with them!</p> 

[Different Times of the Day!](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/DifferentTimesofDayActivity.pdf)

<p>The second activity will expose your child to the wonderful world of time tellers. Aside from our humble clock, there are so many other key instruments that measure and record time. Can your child name all of the ones in this printable activity?</p> 

[Different Time Tellers!](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/DifferentTimeTellersActivity.pdf)
<br>
<p>Do you know that Sundials were one of the first time-telling devices invented? See if your child can guess what the sundial uses to tell time!</p>
<br>

<h4>LET'S TRY THESE AT HOME!</h4>
<p>With a little bit of creativity and using objects found around you, you can create simple yet fun activities for your child to do to supplement their reading.</p>
<p>How about giving the two activities below a try? They will give your child a little peek into history on how people told time before clocks as well as understand the difference between Analog and Digital clocks.</p>
<h4>Activity 1: How Did People Tell Time Before Clocks?</h4>

<img src="/images/TellingTimewiththeSun.png" style="width:400px; text-align:left;">

<p>1. In the morning, at around 9-10am, ask your child if they can see the sun from the window. Ask them to describe the sun; e.g. does it look further away or closer or does it feel hotter?</p> 
<p>2. Have them write down or draw their observations. They can fill up the table appended below.</p>
	
[My Observation Table](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/MyObservationTable.pdf)
	
<p>3. Repeat this activity at 12-1pm and again, at 5-6pm. Ask them if they notice any difference in the sun's position in their observations. </p>
<p>4. Explain to your child that before clocks, this was one of the earliest ways people told time; by looking at the position of the sun in relation to where they lived.</p> 
<p>5. Have your child think more deeply or discover more by asking them how people told time during rainy or cloudy weather. <p>	
<p>Note: Do remind your child to take breaks as prolonged staring at the sun may damage their eyes.</p>

<h4>Activity 2: Analog vs Digital</h4>

<img src="/images/AnalogvsDigital.png" style="width:400px; text-align:left;">
<p>
In this modern world, clocks come in all different shapes, sizes, and forms. Analog clocks may still be around, but we start seeing digital clocks crop up more and more. This simple game will ensure your child do not get confused as they are more exposed to these advanced timepieces.</p> 
<p>1. On a deck of flash cards or strips of leftover paper, write down the time as your child would see on an analog clock; e.g. 5pm.</p> 
<p>2. On another set of cards or strips, write down the same timing in digital format; e.g. 1700. </p>
<p>3. Explain to your child that these are the same timings but in different formats.</p> 
<p>4. Once they become more confident, start writing down timings in analog format and have them rewrite the timings in digital formats. Take turns being Analog and being Digital.</p> 
<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4>
<p>Observing their environment and identifying differences is an easy way to get children thinking in a more scientific manner. Guide them along with probing questions: why do they think that way and how did they come to that conclusion? As time is abstract, do not feel discouraged if your child takes a while to understand. With consistent encouragement, they will eventually get the hang of it.</p>
<h4>LET'S WATCH!</h4>
<p>Unwind with your child with these helpful videos in understanding horology, the study of time, a little better. Horology itself is a word that you can teach your children!</p>

<p><b>Suitable for 4 to 6 years old children</b></p>
<p>Whether it is bath time or dishwashing time, your child would be exposed to liquid soap and soap foam. Why not take these moments as opportunities to spark their curiosity about the densities of everyday objects? In this package, introduce your child to the concept of density, allow them to experiment with household liquid materials, and create ‘fireworks’ in a bottle together!<p>
<h4>Let’s Talk About:</h4>
<p><b>DENSITY</p></b>
<p>Density is a measurement that compares the amount of matter an object as to its volume.</p>
