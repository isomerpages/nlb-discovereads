#### Early Literacy Practice : Talk

![](/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/talk.jpg) 

**Tips for Talking and Communication (Ages 0 to 3)**
* Nurture your babbling baby into a talkative toddler by talking and reading to them often
* Read aloud and encourage your child to read along with you. Initiate conversations about stories by asking, "What do you see on this page?"
* Make strong connections to what your child sees in books and in their environment. Your child will be excited to point these things out!

**Early Literacy Activities You Can Do With Your Child**
* Make different animal sounds with your child such as moo, baa, hiss, neigh, and meow. Take turns making an animal sound and talking about the animal that produces it.
* Talk about emotions with your child. Ask, "How are you feeling?" and teach them some words to describe their feelings e.g. mad, sad, glad. Come up with a Feelings and Emotions chart, with images of different facial expressions next to each emotion for your child to identify.

**Tips for Encouraging Singing (Ages 0 to 3)**



#### For Ages 0 to 12 Months

**What is Early Literacy?**<br>
Early Literacy is what children know about reading or writing before they actually learn to read and write. There are six pre-reading skills that a child needs to develop to become a reader. These skills are in turn supported by the five Early Literacy Practices which are **READ, PLAY, SING, TALK, WRITE!**

**Tips for Selecting Books**<br>
Choose books with:<br>
•	bright and bold illustrations set against a contrasting background <br>
•	lift-the-flap or pop-up features to delight and engage your baby <br>
•	touch and feel elements to help your baby explore the sense of touch and learn how different things feel

**Early Literacy Activities**<br>
•	Sing to your baby everyday and fill your rhymes with funny sound effects and different voices
<br>
•	Name body parts during bath time or diaper changing time
<br>
•	Play 'What's in the Bag?' game. Place 4-6 toys/household objects in a bag.  Get your baby to pull out any objects from the bag. Say out loud the name of the object. 

**Tips for Parents**<br>
Infants will enjoy looking through wordless picture books or books that have just a single word alongside an eye-catching illustration. <br>

**Watch Me!**
<br>Learning to read starts from infancy. Help your child develop the love of reading through books, songs and daily experiences that are vital in the development of your baby's early literacy skills.

#### For Ages 1 to 3 Years
<br>
<img src="/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/1to3banner.png" style="width:80%">

**Tips for Selecting Books**<br>
•		Choose books that feature objects that are part of their everyday lives.  For example, familiar situation such as going to school, running around the playground and visiting the supermarket.<br>
•	Read rhyming books or books with repetitive phrases. This helps them to predict what comes next. <br>
•	Choose books with simple story line and stories with familiar characters.

**Early Literacy Activities**<br>
• Get your child to make the letters of the alphabet or numbers using playdough <br>
•	Play ‘I Spy’ game. For example, ‘I spy with my little eye, something that is blue. What is something blue I might be looking at?’.<br>
•	Play rhyming games by asking your child to come up with pairs of words that sound similar.

**Tips for Parents**<br>
Set time to read daily with your child. Reading stories at bedtime is a great way to get reading into their daily routine.

**Author:** Steve Smallman & Cee Biscoe (Illustrator)<br>
**Publisher:** Wilton, CT : Tiger Tales, 2021.<br>
Gruff is one great, big, scowly, growly grizzly grump of a bear. In fact, he's so grumpy that all the forest animals call him Gruff the Grump. But Gruff doesn't care.

Except, that is, for one disarmingly-earnest little rabbit, whose winning ways find in Gruff a big, kind friend.
