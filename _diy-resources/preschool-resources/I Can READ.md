**Tips For Developing Writing Skills (Ages 2-4)**
* At the pre-writing stage, children do not need to write legibly – being able to scribble or trace is a good start.
* Choose books with finger-trails, large numbers or letters that provide opportunities for children to practice tracing.
* Try to model writing for your child. Introduce them to the conventions of writing – from left to right of the page and from top to bottom.

**Early Literacy Activities You Can Do With Your Child**

<img src="/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/writingcrayons.jpg" style="width:70%">

* Let your child explore coloring. Using crayons and paper, encourage your child to colour or scribble. This simple activity helps to build their motor skills.
* Let your child learn to write their name through finger- painting. Write out your child’s name on a paper. Have your child trace over what you have written with child-friendly non-toxic paint.

**Tips For Encouraging Play (Ages 4-6)**
* Try books with pictures of familiar characters, like animals, children or adults in familiar roles. Look for books that have action pictures - your baby is starting to be able to enjoy pictures with more details.
* Choose books with songs and repetitive verses. Books that have a simple story line that relates to your child's own experiences will also be appealing to them.

**Early Literacy Activities You Can Do With Your Child**

<img src="/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/playdough.jpg" style="width:80%">

* Together with your child, use playdough to make the letters of the alphabet or numbers.
* Play games like ‘I spy’ using colours. This can be lots of fun, especially for preschoolers. For example, ‘I spy with my little eye, something that’s blue. What’s something blue I might be looking at?’.

**Watch Me!**<br>
Playing has many benefits for early literacy development. Learn how you can build upon your child's vocabulary and narrative skills through play.

<img src="/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/talk.jpg" style="width:70%">

**Tips for Talking and Communication (Ages 0 to 3)**
* Nurture your babbling baby into a talkative toddler by talking and reading to them often.
* Read aloud and encourage your child to read along with you. Initiate conversations about stories by asking, "What do you see on this page?"
* Make strong connections to what your child sees in books and in their environment. Your child will be excited to point these things out!

**Early Literacy Activities You Can Do With Your Child**

<img src="/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/animals.jpg" style="width:80%">

* Make different animal sounds with your child such as moo, baa, hiss, neigh, and meow. Take turns making an animal sound and talking about the animal that produces it.
* Talk about emotions with your child. Ask, "How are you feeling?" and teach them some words to describe their feelings e.g. mad, sad, glad. Come up with a Feelings and Emotions chart, with images of different facial expressions next to each emotion for your child to identify.

<img src="/images/sing.jpg" style="width:50%">

**Tips for Encouraging Singing (Ages 0 to 3)**
* Singing helps your child learn how to hear smaller sounds in words, developing phonological awareness which will help your child learn to read. Don’t be afraid of being silly or singing off-key!
* Read books that can be sung. These can include nursery and finger rhymes, poems, books that promote singing, or books that can be sung to a specific tune.

**Early Literacy Activities You Can Do With Your Child**

<img src="/images/diyresources/preschool/i-can-read/singingrhymes.jpg" style="width:70%">

* Sing nursery rhymes to your child. As you sing, touch your child’s toes, knees, shoulders, head and so on. You can also get your child to clap, dance, and sway to the rhythm of the music.
* Gather objects or pictures that rhyme with each other and ask your child to name them. You can even add an odd one out for your child to identify the different sounds made by the various words.

**Watch Me!** <br>
Singing has many benefits for early literacy development. Learn how you can build upon your child’s phonological awareness and narrative skills through singing.

**What is Early Literacy?**<br>
Early Literacy is what children know about reading or writing before they actually learn to read and write. There are six pre-reading skills that a child needs to develop to become a reader. These skills are in turn supported by the five Early Literacy Practices which are **READ, PLAY, SING, TALK, WRITE!**

**Tips for Selecting Books**<br>
Choose books with:<br>
•	bright and bold illustrations set against a contrasting background <br>
•	lift-the-flap or pop-up features to delight and engage your baby <br>
•	touch and feel elements to help your baby explore the sense of touch and learn how different things feel

**Early Literacy Activities**<br>
•	Sing to your baby everyday and fill your rhymes with funny sound effects and different voices
<br>
•	Name body parts during bath time or diaper changing time
<br>
•	Play 'What's in the Bag?' game. Place 4-6 toys/household objects in a bag.  Get your baby to pull out any objects from the bag. Say out loud the name of the object. 

**Tips for Parents**<br>
Infants will enjoy looking through wordless picture books or books that have just a single word alongside an eye-catching illustration. <br>

**Watch Me!**
<br>Learning to read starts from infancy. Help your child develop the love of reading through books, songs and daily experiences that are vital in the development of your baby's early literacy skills.

**Tips for Selecting Books**<br>
•	Choose books with longer storylines. Try choosing contemporary realistic fiction titles that describe situations that children can overcome and relate to.<BR>
•	Choose books where the main character is the same age as your child<BR>
•	Choose wordless books that allow your child to describe or narrate the actions and events in the story
	
**Early Literacy Activities**<br>
•	Talk about the stories you have read with your child. ‘What was the story about?’. ‘If you are the author, how would you end the story?’.<BR>
•	Ask your child to come up with words that start with the same letter as the word you are reading.<BR>
•	Spend time with your child to make a storybook using their own drawings.

**Tips for Parents**<br>
When reading aloud, engage your child actively by asking questions, discussing what is happening and making predictions about the plot or the ending.

**Title:** [Gruff the Grump](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=205571494)<br>
**Author:** Steve Smallman & Cee Biscoe (Illustrator)<br>
**Publisher:** Wilton, CT : Tiger Tales, 2021.<br>
Gruff is one great, big, scowly, growly grizzly grump of a bear. In fact, he's so grumpy that all the forest animals call him Gruff the Grump. But Gruff doesn't care. Plus, his grumpy reputation is perfect for keeping the other forest animals out of his way. Except, that is, for one disarmingly-earnest little rabbit, whose winning ways find in Gruff a big, kind friend.

**Publisher:** New York : Random House Studio, an imprint of Random House Children's Books, [2021].<br>
