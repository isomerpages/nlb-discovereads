**What is Early Literacy?**<br>
Early Literacy is what children know about reading or writing before they actually learn to read and write. There are 6 pre-reading skills that a child needs to develop to become a reader. These skills are in turn supported by the 5 Early Literacy Practices which are **READ, PLAY, SING, TALK, WRITE!**

**Tips for Selecting books**<br>
•	Books with bright and bold illustrations set against a contrasting background. <br>
•	Flip-a-flap and pop-up books to delight and attract baby’s attention.<br>
•	Touch and feel books to help your baby explore the sense of touch and learn how different things feel.

**Early Literacy Activities**<br>
•	Sing to your baby everyday and fill your rhymes with funny sound effects and different voices.<br>
•	Name body parts during bath time or diaper change time.
<br>
•	Build with blocks. Babies learn about spatial relationship and problem solving when they play with blocks.

**Watch Me!**
<br>Learning to read starts from birth. Whether through books, words, or songs – daily language experiences help form an emotional bond with your baby and are vital to the development of your baby’s early literacy skills.
