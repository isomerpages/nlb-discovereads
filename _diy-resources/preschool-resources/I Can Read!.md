**1. What is Early Literacy?**
<br>
Early Literacy is what children know about reading or writing before they actually learn to read and write. There are 6 pre-reading skills that a child needs to develop to become a reader. These skills are in turn supported by the 5 Early Literacy Practices which are READ, WRITE, SING, TALK AND PLAY!

**2. Tips for Selecting books (ages 0 to 12 months)**

•	Books with bright and bold illustrations set against a contrasting background.

•	Flip-a-flap and pop-up books to delight and attract baby’s attention.

•	Touch and feel books to help your baby explore the sense of touch and learn how different things feel.

**3. Early Literacy Activities**

•	Sing to your baby everyday and fill your rhymes with funny sound effects and different voices.

•	Name body parts during bath time or diaper change time.

•	Build with blocks. Babies learn about spatial relationship and problem solving when they play with blocks.

**Title:** [I’m Happy-Sad Today!](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=204007445) <br>
**Author:** Lory Britain, Ph.D.  <br>

Happy, and also sad. Excited, but nervous too. Feeling friendly, with a little shyness mixed in. Mixed feelings are natural, but they can be confusing. There are different kinds of happy--the quiet kind and the "noisy, giggly, jump and run" kind. And there are conflicting feelings, like proud and jealous, frustrated and determined.
