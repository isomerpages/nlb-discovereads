## **Early Literacy Practices**

_(Updated in January 2022)_

Research shows that there are six early literacy skills (vocabulary, print awareness, phonological awareness, narrative skills, letter knowledge and print motivation) that children need to pick up on their way to becoming fluent readers. These early literacy skills are in turn supported by the five early literacy practices which are simply talk, sing, write, play and read! As long as you are singing, talking, writing, playing and reading with your child regularly, you are laying the foundation for your child's reading success.
