## **Read**

### **Introduction**

Reading with children develops their language and literacy skills. Words can be found all around us, for example, on cereal boxes and advertisements. Recognizing such **environmental print** allows children to differentiate text from pictures at an early age by reading the words in their immediate surroundings.

Reading books to children teaches them how to handle books as well as how text flows from left to right and from top to bottom of a page. In addition, books expose children to words they may not learn through daily conversation. Parents should also talk to children about what they have read together to help them understand the story.
 
### **Recommended Activities**

**Label Away!** <br>
Label everything around your house that your child may use. This can include boxes, chairs, boxes and even toys. Each time you mention the item or when your child uses it, point to the label and say the word clearly. Over time, you child will learn to read the labels and learn the names of these items. This activity is suitable for toddlers aged 0-2 years old.

**Read A Book A Day** <br>
There’s no better way to learn reading than by reading! Read a book with your child today. Ensure that they can see the words and illustrations as you are reading the book together. You can even get them to read some of the words or a repeated phrase from the story. Talk about the story (What did you like about it? What would you do if it happened to you?). The reading can begin even when you are choosing books from the library to read together. Browse different books and read the front and back covers with them to see which they would like to borrow. Go through some of the pages, if it helps to make the choosing easier! This activity is great for young children of all ages.

**Let's Go Shopping!** <br>
Bring your child to the supermarket with you! Have them gather the items you need to buy and take the opportunity to point out the product labels and aisle signs. You can also play fun activities such as only buying snacks they can spell or read. For example, crackers or  mint chocolate chip ice-cream. You can also create more reading opportunities by writing a shopping list in advance and have them check items off the list for you. Suitable for all young children.
