## **Talk**

### **Introduction**

Talking helps a child develop early literacy skills. Nurture your babbling baby into a talkative toddler by talking and reading to him often. Talking is also an excellent way to build his narrative skills. These skills are needed to help him with reading as he grows older.

Read aloud and encourage your child to read along with you. You can initiate conversations about stories by asking, “What do you see on this page?” or “What do you think will happen next?”

## **Recommended Activities**

**What Is the Weather Today?** <br>
Make a simple “Weather Chart” and get your child to fill the chart as you talk about the weather daily. Talk about the activities they can or cannot do and what they need to wear or bring depending on the weather that day. For example, “It is sunny today. We can play outside!” or “It will rain today. You need to carry an umbrella.” 

If you have older children, use picture books to talk about the different weathers and seasons in other countries. Engage in pretend play by getting your child to imagine that they live in a different country. Ask questions like, “What would you wear during winter?” or “What would you eat or drink on a snowy day?” You can also talk about the science behind each weather or season.. Complement the discussion with fun experiments like creating your own rainfall, lightning, and rainbow!

**I am Thankful** <br>
Talking about the things that one is thankful for is a great way to instil and cultivate gratitude in our children. Explain to your child what gratitude means and provide simple examples. For a start, encourage your child to say “Thank you”. You will probably need to prompt your child in the beginning. For instance, “What do you say to your sister/brother for sharing their toys with you?” 

As your child grows older, you can get your child to create a “Gratitude Tree or Flower” by writing down or drawing the things and people that they are thankful for on each flower petal or leaf. Alternatively, you can get your child to take photos of what they are grateful for. Spend some time to read what they have written and look at the photos together and talk about them. Ask questions like, “How do you feel when you receive this gift?” and “What else can we do to show our gratitude to someone?”

**When I Grow Up** <br>
Discover your child’s interests by talking about jobs.. As your child’s biggest role model, begin by sharing what you do at home and work! Introduce your child to other jobs in the community. Talk about how each job requires people to work at different places and use different tools and skills. For instance, “The cashier at the supermarket helps you to check out your groceries. He uses a cash register.” Or “The artist creates an artwork by painting on a canvas.” Make learning more fun by playing dress-up. Get your child to put on different clothes for the different jobs. You can also incorporate a treasure hunt by hiding the tools related to the different jobs and getting your child to find the items. 

For older children, get them to name and talk about a job that begins with a letter of your choice. For instance, “Name a job that begins with A and tell me what you know about it.” Most importantly, ask your child about their aspirations and dreams!
