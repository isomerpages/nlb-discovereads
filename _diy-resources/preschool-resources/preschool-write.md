## **Write**

### **Introduction**

Writing helps children develop motor skills and understand that written words represent ideas. It allows children to express themselves through language. Through writing, they also learn the conventions of written language and how to read. At the pre-writing stage, they do not need to write legibly – being able to scribble or trace is a good start.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Shapes and Numbers** <br>
Shapes and numbers are simple concepts that children aged 2-3 can learn. When they practise  drawing shapes and writing numbers, they are learning that writing represent concepts or ideas. Here is a fun way to combine shapes and numbers in an activity. Using cutouts or toys, have various numbers jumbled up across a page. Invite your child to draw a different shape around certain numbers. For example, “Draw a circle around all 5s and 8s. Draw a square around all 2s and 3s.” 

**What’s the Missing Letter?** <br>
Letter knowledge is one of the pre-reading skills that your child needs to become a fluent reader. It means being able to recognise the letters in the alphabet and the sounds they make. One way that you can help your child to develop this skill is to have your child fill in a series of words that contain certain letters. Example: “F_ _E (Fire); E_ _S (Eggs); S_ _T (Spot); T_ _E (Time)”.

**Clay Modelling** <br>
Learning to write is not limited to using pencils. Inject more fun in writing activities by using modelling clay. Read a story together with your child and form letter or words used in the story using modelling clay. Your child can also form the objects that the words stand for as well. For younger children, you may guide them to form the items.
