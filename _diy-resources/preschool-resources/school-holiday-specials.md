Title: [Hats Are Not For Cats!](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=203958583)<br>
Author & Illustrator: Jacqueline K. Rayner
Publisher: Boston; New York: Clarion Books, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2019

A  big, plaid-hat-wearing dog insists that the small black cat in the red fez shouldn't be wearing a hat—any kind of hat—because hats are for dogs. His patronizing tirade doesn’t convince this cat, however. Defiantly, she wears an assortment of hats, described in the gleeful rhyming text, and brings in other cats to join the protest. The silliness of both text and pictures offers a cheerful take on bossiness and managing conflict, with a win-win resolution.

**Illustrator:** Matthew Rivera <br>
**Publisher:** Minneapolis, MN : Free Spirit Publishing Inc., \[2019\] <br>

Happy, and also sad. Excited, but nervous too. Feeling friendly, with a little shyness mixed in. Mixed feelings are natural, but they can be confusing. There are different kinds of happy--the quiet kind and the "noisy, giggly, jump and run" kind. And there are conflicting feelings, like proud and jealous, frustrated and determined. With gentle messaging and charming illustrations, a little girl talks about her many layered feelings, ultimately concluding, "When I have more than one feeling inside me, I don't have to choose just one. I know that all my feelings are okay at the same time." A special section for adults presents ideas for helping children explore their emotions, build a vocabulary of feeling words, know what to do if they feel overwhelmed, and more.

It is only when he starts to notice other animals have clever tricks to calm down that Fergal begins to win back his friends, especially when he discovers dragons can cool off in a very handy way.

Click flashlights, light lanterns, and get ready to turn electric lights out to celebrate Earth Hour! Wherever you are, you can help our planet.

Kids around the world use electric energy to do all kinds of things–adults do, too! From cleaning the clothes we play in, to lighting up our dinner tables, to keeping us warm and toasty when the weather is cold, electricity is a huge part of our lives. Unfortunately, it can also have a big impact on our planet.

Earth Hour–a worldwide movement in support of energy conservation and sustainability–takes place each March and is sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF). During Earth Hour, individuals, communities, and businesses in more than 7,000 cities turn off nonessential electric lights for one hour. Across each continent–from the Eiffel Tower to the Great Wall of China to the Statue of Liberty–one small act reminds all of us of our enormous impact on planet Earth.
