## **Play**

### **Introduction**

Play enables children to develop their language, social-emotional and cognitive skills. It also encourages imagination and creativity. Learning through play comes in many forms such as imaginary play, cooperative play and physical play. They are further categorised into instructional play, games, guided and free play, depending on the degree in which children are given control over their experiences during play.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Mystery Bag**

Place a few small items into a bag. You can use items that your child is familiar with such as toys, pieces of clothing and stationery. Get your child to place their hands into the bag and identify the object just by using their sense of touch. For a variety of textures, you can also use items from nature such as leaves, grass, sticks and pebbles. 

To make this activity more challenging for older children, use items which have one thing in common or those that fall under the same category. For instance, you can place a few items which begin with the same letter. Get your child to name the objects and guess what they have in common.

**Lacing Cards**

This simple activity helps develop fine motor skills. You will need some foam sheets or cardboard, a paper puncher and colourful shoelaces. Cut out simple shapes such as a circle, square or star from the foam sheets. Punch holes along the edges of the shapes and get et your child to string the shoelaces through the holes of each shape.

Make this activity more challenging by cutting the outlines of objects or animals. The completed lacing cards are also great for decorating your child’s room.

**The Magic Box**

Free play or unstructured play helps exercise your child’s creativity and problem-solving skills. A simple way to encourage free play at home is to create a magic box. 

Fill a box with materials that can be used in different ways for free play such as balls, scarves, small plushies and wooden blocks. You may include modelling clay, sheets of recycled paper and other safe craft materials for older children so that they can make their own props.
