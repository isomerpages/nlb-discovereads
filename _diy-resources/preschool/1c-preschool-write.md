## **Write**

### **Introduction**

Writing helps children develop motor skills and understand that written words represent ideas. It allows children to express themselves through language. Through writing, they also learn the conventions of written language and how to read. At the pre-writing stage, they do not need to write legibly – being able to scribble and or trace is a good start.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Draw Your Own Wordless Story** <br>
Pick up any wordless book and share it with your child. Encourage your child to share their thoughts about the story by asking them questions. After completing the story, get your child to recreate the story by drawing what they can recall from the story. This activity is suitable for children aged 4-6 years old.

**Alphabet Dance** <br>
Kids love actions and movements. Play a fun game with your child by “drawing” the alphabet with your body. You can take turns with your child to guess which letter is being drawn! Have a good laugh seeing each other dance! This activity is suitable for children aged 4-6 years old.

**Road Numbers** <br>
Prepare printouts of numbers one to ten using road markings.. You may use black and white construction paper or use shapes in power point to create these different roads. . Using your child’s toy car, trace the numbers by moving the car on the “road”. You can also create various road patterns like straight road or zig-zag road. This activity is suitable for children aged 0-3 years old.
