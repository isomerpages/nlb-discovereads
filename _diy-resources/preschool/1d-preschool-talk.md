## **Talk**

### **Introduction**

Talking helps a child develop early literacy skills. Nurture your babbling baby into a talkative toddler by talking and reading to him often. Talking is also an excellent way to build his narrative skills. These skills are needed to help him with reading as he grows older.

Read aloud and encourage your child to read along with you. You can initiate conversations about stories by asking, “What do you see on this page?” or “What do you think will happen next?”

## **Recommended Activities**

**Animal Sounds** <br>
Making animal sounds is a great way for children to develop their speech.  Place some animal toys in a bag and get your child to pull out one animal toy at a time. As your child pulls out an animal toy, they will have to name the animal and make its sound.  Alternatively, you can use animal books or pictures of animals. 

Make the activity more fun by incorporating the song “When Cows Wake up in the Morning” into the activity or get your child to combine the sounds of two animals. . For example, “If a sheep says baa and a cat goes meow, what does a sheep-cat say? Baa-ow, Baa-ow!” If you have older children participating in the activity, get them to guess where the animal lives or what it eats.

**Yummy Food!** <br>
Mealtimes are great opportunities for families to communicate. During mealtimes, name and describe the taste, colour and texture of food that the family is having. For example, “Today, we are having some strawberries. Strawberries are red, soft and sweet.”

If you have older children, engage in pretend play and get them to imagine having a meal with their favourite book or movie character. Ask questions like, “What would you eat with your favourite character?” and “What do you think your favourite character likes to eat?”

**Vroom I Spot a Truck!** <br>
While taking a walk or a bus ride with your child, point to each vehicle that passes by and say its name.  To help your child learn how to make sentences, use descriptive words and verbs as you talk about the vehicle. For example, “Look at the blue car. It goes very fast.” Or “The red motorcycle stops at the traffic light.”

As your child gets older, you can introduce other vehicles that are more challenging to pronounce such as cranes, forklifts and bulldozers. Make learning more fun by engaging in a game of “I Spy” and get them to spot the correct vehicle. For example, “I spy a vehicle which begins with T.”

An irresistibly cute story about finding the confidence to be yourself, starring a turtle in search of the perfect shell.

Terrance the turtle was born without a shell, so he uses a cardboard box instead. Terrance loves his box. It keeps him dry on soggy days, safe from snooping strangers, and is big enough to cozy up with a friend. But when another turtle points out that Terrance’s shell is, well, weird, he begins to wonder whether there might be a better shell out there…

Eventually, and through much trial and error, Terrance learns that there’s nothing wrong with being different–especially when it comes to being yourself.

What if a dandelion became a dandy lion? With enchanting, ethereal art, this is a wordless story where reality is transformed by imagination.

In a meadow filled with dandelion buds just about to flower, one dandelion blooms into a real lion. Roots and leaves unfurl into four tiny paws and a long tail with a fluffy yellow tuft. What a great, wide world there is to explore when you have paws instead of roots! There are fast trains to ride, regal ships to sail, and cities with lights as bright as Dandelion’s field in full bloom. But will a real lion ever be content to go back to being a rooted dandelion?
