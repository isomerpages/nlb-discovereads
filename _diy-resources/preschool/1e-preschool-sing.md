## **Sing**

### **Introduction**

Singing helps your child learn how to hear smaller sounds in words.  Learning to hear and break down parts of words help your child develop phonological awareness, which will help him learn to read.

Do not be afraid of being silly or singing off-key; your child will not mind at all.  He is more likely to love the great bonding experience of singing with you!  Children also remember things better when they are said in a rhyme or sung to a catchy tune.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Sing Fast, Sing Slow** <br>
This is a great activity for your child to sing and learn tempo at the same time. You can sing nursery rhymes together with your child and change the tempo by singing fast or singing slow. Challenge each other to see how fast you can go!

To add on to the activity, you can dance together with your child by doing actions as you sing along. Introduce action words written on paper to help your child recognize and link the words with their respective actions.

**Musical Crafts** <br>
Engage your child through making musical crafts together. It could be as easy as hitting chopsticks on turned-over pots or creating a shaker by putting beans into a bottle. Create your very own musical crafts by using various materials. Take the opportunity to go through the names of the materials. For older children, you can even have a checklist and ask your child to locate the materials in the house.

To add on to the activity, you can form a band with your child, to sing and dance together, using the musical crafts created. 

**Recreating Nursery Rhymes** <br>
Have fun with your child by replacing words in familiar nursery rhymes with similar rhyming words. For example, replacing “Humpty Dumpty” with “Bumpty Zumpty”. The words may sound silly, but it encourages your child to learn about different sounds of the alphabets.

To add on to the activity, create a brand-new nursery rhyme by using your own words and following a well-known nursery tune. Sing and dance to your new nursery rhyme!

Incy Wincy Spider combines lively pictures with a classic rhyme that’s easy for parents and carers to recognise and recite. Young children will adore searching the page for flaps to open while singing along. The spotting game at the end is a great incentive to go through the pages once again until each tiny thing is found! Nursery Rhymes are important stepping stones to language development. The rhymes usually tell a story, too, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. This teaches children that events happen in sequence, and they begin to follow along. Nursery rhymes are also full of repetition making them easy to remember, and often become some of a child’s first sentences.
