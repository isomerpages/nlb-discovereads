## **Sing**

### **Introduction**

Singing helps your child learn how to hear smaller sounds in words.  Learning to hear and break down parts of words help your child develop phonological awareness, which will help him learn to read.

Do not be afraid of being silly or singing off-key; your child will not mind at all.  He is more likely to love the great bonding experience of singing with you!  Children also remember things better when they are said in a rhyme or sung to a catchy tune.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Matching Pictures and Songs** <br>
Prepare picture cards related to nursery songs. For example, use a picture of a star to refer to “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” song, and a picture of sheep to refer to “Baa Baa Black Sheep” song. You may also add in sight words, such as “star” or “sheep” on the cards. Sing the nursery songs together as your child picks different cards. 

To extend the activity, you can prepare an additional set of picture cards - you can use 4 different pairs of cards with similar pictures for each pair. Randomly place the sets of cards with pictures facing down. Engage your child in a friendly game to find matching picture cards. 

To add on to the activity, you can dance together with your child by doing actions as you sing along. Introduce action words written on paper to help your child recognize and link the words with their respective actions.

**Dramatic Play** <br>
Have fun with your child by pretending to be characters of nursery songs and rhymes such as “The Wheels on the Bus” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm”. Such pretend play helps your child better understand and remember the songs and rhymes. 

To extend the activity, introduce new elements such as plot twist to the scenario or new characters. For example, adding a new animal on Old MacDonald’s farm and changing the song accordingly. 

**Dance and Freeze** <br>
Simply sing nursery songs and dance together with your child. Stop singing and freeze your actions at various points of the song. The magic key to resume the song is for your child to recall the last word that was sung! Introduce the word to your child, and have your child repeat the word. You can then start singing and dancing together again. 

To extend the activity, you can guide your child to write down the various “magic” words.
