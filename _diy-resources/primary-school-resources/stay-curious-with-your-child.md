### **Upcycle Your Clothes!**

Children grow quickly, and this means their clothes may not fit after a few years. Instead of throwing away clothes that they have outgrown, why not create a reusable bag with your child? This eco-friendly activity can be completed in less than 10 minutes.

**You'll need:**

* Scissors<br>
* Old t-shirt<br>
* Ruler<br>

**Those Shoes**<br>
by: Maribeth Boelts<br>
Publisher: Candlewick, 2016<br>

All Jeremy wants is a pair of those shoes, the ones everyone at school seems to be wearing. Though Jeremy’s grandma says they don’t have room for "want," just "need," when his old shoes fall apart at school, he is more determined than ever to have those shoes, even a thrift-shop pair that are much too small. But sore feet aren’t much fun, and Jeremy soon sees that the things he has — warm boots, a loving grandma, and the chance to help a friend — are worth more than the things he wants.

**Earth Friends: Fair Fashion**<br>
By: Holly Webb <br>
Publisher: Nosy Crow, 2021<br>

The first fantastic book in the series about four friends who want to make the world a better place. Researching her school project on Fairtrade has been a real eye-opener for Maya. She loves clothes and is appalled to find that her favourite sparkly T-shirts are made by poor children in other countries who lead very different lives from her own, privileged one. She knows she must do something about it, but how can she make a difference without revealing her pop star secret to the world?

**Clothing Warrior: Going Green**<br>
By: Claudia Martin <br>
Publisher: Bearport Publishing, 2021<br>

Landfills are piled high with tossed clothes and shoes, clothing hangers harm our flying friends, and tiny microfibers from our fabrics are becoming fish food. What a waste! But there's a way to help. Be a waste warrior to put a stop to clothing waste and join the battle to save Earth! Honest text introduces some of Earth's biggest waste problems, while helpful solutions provide a way for readers to combat the issues. A final eco-activity pairs simple steps with illustrations to give waste warriors a hands-on activity to fight clothing waste.

**Tip for parents**

Did you know that clothes have a significant environmental impact? The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of the global carbon dioxide output, more than international flights and shipping combined!

With this in mind, families can try to extend the life of clothes together, such as buying responsibly, donating hand-me-downs, repairing or upcycling them.

**Tip for parents**

Develop your child’s spatial thinking skills through the reading and understanding of maps. Map-reading helps children visualise where objects and places are in relation to one another, and aids with the recognition of abstract symbols as representations of the real world.

While maps are usually produced on paper, they can be found on scrolls, stone engravings, paper fans and even ceramics! Did you know that in the 1800s, the Japanese used maps of Japan as a decoration for porcelain ware such as plates? You can try making your own decorated plate with your child by drawing a map of your favourite places in Singapore on the back of a paper plate!

**Tips for Parents**

Baking is an activity that relies on chemistry! Baking motivates curious young foodies to try out hands-on experiments where they get to explore Science beyond the classroom. 
You can encourage your child to experiment during baking with these simple steps:

1.	Try out recipes with different ingredient variables. For example, some cakes might use vegetable oil instead of butter.
2.	Test the results and record it down! What is the texture and taste like? Ask your child if the results meet their expectations. 
3.	Ask your child questions and find out the answers together through online research! Why are some cakes fluffy and airy compared to others? Why does too much baking soda make a cake taste soapy?

**Tips for Parents**

The value of art for children has been commonly articulated, but abstract art is particularly beneficial for them as it allows children to directly express what they see, feel, and experience.
For parents, engaging in conversations with your child about their artwork allows them to develop communication and cognitive skills. Ask them questions about the colours and shapes used and their feelings when creating it. These conversations will help your child build up their vocabulary and better identify their emotions.

**Tips for Parents**

There are many benefits to podcasts that help to support children’s learning in an entertaining and educational way. When listening to podcasts, children’s imaginations are more actively engaged compared to watching a video as children have to create the images in their minds, rather than simply processing visual stimuli presented to them. Podcasts can also accelerate learning by improving their comprehension ability beyond what they are able to read on the page. Learn more about the benefits of podcasts and how to select the right one for your kids.

**Tips for Parents**

In the kampong days, games were created purely from imagination and using random items lying around. Children, as well as adults, invented a lot of fun games to play. That was how traditional games came about. Why not come up with your own games with things found at home or try out some of these  other traditional games.

Tools, such as a stapler or a pair of scissors, are useful in making our daily lives easier. However, if used incorrectly, they can be potentially dangerous. Follow these steps when teaching your child how to use a new tool:

Step 1: Teach them how to use the tool safely.<br>
Step 2: Show them how the tools should be safely stored away and kept when not in use.<br>
Step 3: Remind them they should always ask for an adult’s permission before using the tool.<br>

**Tips for Parents**

To manage your child’s screen time, consider stopping all screen use one hour before bedtime. This allows your child’s sleep hormone (melatonin) to rise naturally. It also gives you time to do a bedtime routine with your child to promote parent-child bonding. You can offer fun alternatives, such as reading and storytelling, jigsaw puzzles or family board games.

**Tips for Parents**

Raise children to be a giving generation rather than a give-me generation. Parents can encourage a spirit of generosity by letting children know when they themselves perform acts of kindness and how such actions make them feel. By doing so, parents model generosity and help children see how kindness can be practised in everyday situations. Create opportunities for children to contribute time, money and personal items so they can understand, despite their age, they too can make a difference.

**Tip for Parents**

Encourage scientific thinking in your child by exploring and finding answers together when your child asks you questions. Don’t jump in with the right answers immediately. Prompt questions and give your child some time to think and experiment.

**Tip for Parents**

Did you know that doodling can help with stress relief? While doodling is often associated as a sign of distraction, psychologists have found that it can also improve one’s ability to focus and recall information.

Try doodling with your child as a creative bonding activity.
