**Tips for Parents**

The value of art for children has been commonly articulated, but abstract art is particularly beneficial for them as it allows children to directly express what they see, feel, and experience.
For parents, engaging in conversations with your child about their artwork allows them to develop communication and cognitive skills. Ask them questions about the colours and shapes used and their feelings when creating it. These conversations will help your child build up their vocabulary and better identify their emotions.

**What's the BIG Idea?**

by Vicki Cobb<br>

**Tips for Parents**

There are many benefits to podcasts that help to support children’s learning in an entertaining and educational way. When listening to podcasts, children’s imaginations are more actively engaged compared to watching a video as children have to create the images in their minds, rather than simply processing visual stimuli presented to them. Podcasts can also accelerate learning by improving their comprehension ability beyond what they are able to read on the page. Learn more about the benefits of podcasts and how to select the right one for your kids.

**100 Games for Children**

Games not only help to keep children fit but motivate them to develop positive attitudes and understand rules.

**Tips for Parents**

In the kampong days, games were created purely from imagination and using random items lying around. Children, as well as adults, invented a lot of fun games to play. That was how traditional games came about. Why not come up with your own games with things found at home or try out some of these  other traditional games.

**Tips for Parents**

To manage your child’s screen time, consider stopping all screen use one hour before bedtime. This allows your child’s sleep hormone (melatonin) to rise naturally. It also gives you time to do a bedtime routine with your child to promote parent-child bonding. You can offer fun alternatives, such as reading and storytelling, jigsaw puzzles or family board games.

**Tips for Parents**

Raise children to be a giving generation rather than a give-me generation. Parents can encourage a spirit of generosity by letting children know when they themselves perform acts of kindness and how such actions make them feel. By doing so, parents model generosity and help children see how kindness can be practised in everyday situations. Create opportunities for children to contribute time, money and personal items so they can understand, despite their age, they too can make a difference.
