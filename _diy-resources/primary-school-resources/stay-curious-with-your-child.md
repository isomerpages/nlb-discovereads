### **Upcycle Your Clothes!**

Children grow quickly, and this means their clothes may not fit after a few years. Instead of throwing away clothes that they have outgrown, why not create a reusable bag with your child? This eco-friendly activity can be completed in less than 10 minutes.

**You'll need:**

* Scissors<br>
* Old t-shirt<br>
* Ruler<br>

**Those Shoes**<br>
by: Maribeth Boelts<br>
Publisher: Candlewick, 2016<br>

All Jeremy wants is a pair of those shoes, the ones everyone at school seems to be wearing. Though Jeremy’s grandma says they don’t have room for "want," just "need," when his old shoes fall apart at school, he is more determined than ever to have those shoes, even a thrift-shop pair that are much too small. But sore feet aren’t much fun, and Jeremy soon sees that the things he has — warm boots, a loving grandma, and the chance to help a friend — are worth more than the things he wants.

**Earth Friends: Fair Fashion**<br>
By: Holly Webb <br>
Publisher: Nosy Crow, 2021<br>

The first fantastic book in the series about four friends who want to make the world a better place. Researching her school project on Fairtrade has been a real eye-opener for Maya. She loves clothes and is appalled to find that her favourite sparkly T-shirts are made by poor children in other countries who lead very different lives from her own, privileged one. She knows she must do something about it, but how can she make a difference without revealing her pop star secret to the world?

**Clothing Warrior: Going Green**<br>
By: Claudia Martin <br>
Publisher: Bearport Publishing, 2021<br>

Landfills are piled high with tossed clothes and shoes, clothing hangers harm our flying friends, and tiny microfibers from our fabrics are becoming fish food. What a waste! But there's a way to help. Be a waste warrior to put a stop to clothing waste and join the battle to save Earth! Honest text introduces some of Earth's biggest waste problems, while helpful solutions provide a way for readers to combat the issues. A final eco-activity pairs simple steps with illustrations to give waste warriors a hands-on activity to fight clothing waste.

**Tip for parents**

Did you know that clothes have a significant environmental impact? The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of the global carbon dioxide output, more than international flights and shipping combined!

With this in mind, families can try to extend the life of clothes together, such as buying responsibly, donating hand-me-downs, repairing or upcycling them.

**Tip for parents**

Introducing your child to the world of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths) isn’t as daunting as it may seem. One easy way to broach these topics is by utilising the environment and activities in your daily life.

When you’re indoors, cooking can be a fun exercise in chemical and physical reactions. If you’re heading out, nature parks present an immersive space to talk about biodiversity. STEAM concepts are all around, and each day is a new opportunity to discover them.

**Tip for parents**
  
Establish a secure online setting by keeping tech use in the open. Children need room to research and socialize. Download the apps your kids use to your own device so that you understand firsthand how they work. You don’t need to be the expert, instead, use the possibility to ask questions of your child. If you exhibit true activity in an app, they may additionally be extra in all likelihood to share it with you.
