Tools, such as a stapler or a pair of scissors, are useful in making our daily lives easier. However, if used incorrectly, they can be potentially dangerous. Follow these steps when teaching your child how to use a new tool:

Step 1: Teach them how to use the tool safely. 
Step 2: Show them how the tools should be safely stored away and kept when not in use.
Step 3: Remind them they should always ask for an adult‚Äôs permission before using the tool.

**Tips for Parents**

To manage your child‚Äôs screen time, consider stopping all screen use one hour before bedtime. This allows your child‚Äôs sleep hormone (melatonin) to rise naturally. It also gives you time to do a bedtime routine with your child to promote parent-child bonding. You can offer fun alternatives, such as reading and storytelling, jigsaw puzzles or family board games.

**Tips for Parents**

Raise children to be a giving generation rather than a give-me generation. Parents can encourage a spirit of generosity by letting children know when they themselves perform acts of kindness and how such actions make them feel. By doing so, parents model generosity and help children see how kindness can be practised in everyday situations. Create opportunities for children to contribute time, money and personal items so they can understand, despite their age, they too can make a difference.
