#### **D.I.Y. Blackout Poetry**

Blackout poetry is a form of poetry where an author picks an existing piece of written text to repurpose into a new poem. 

This is done by keeping a selection of words, and blacking out the remaining words you do not want. The result gives the written text a different meaning than it had before.

There are various ways you can craft a blackout poem, from simply using a single black marker to creating a vibrant and colourful work of art using paint.

Rowena feels like her family is a frayed string of lights that someone needs to fix with electrical tape. After her mother died a few years ago, she and her sister, Ariana, drifted into their own corners of the world, each figuring out in their own separate ways how to exist in a world in which their mother is no longer alive.

But then Ariana disappears under the cover of night in the middle of a snowstorm, leaving no trace or tracks. When Row wakes up to a world of snow and her sister’s empty bedroom, she is left to piece together the mystery behind where Ariana went and why, realizing along the way that she might be part of the reason Ariana is gone.

<a name="id12">![Print-and-Play Boardgames header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-pnp.png)</a>
#### **Print-and-Play Boardgames**

“Boardgaming” has become an increasingly popular hobby in recent years, often seen as a throwback to the days before online gaming.

While they may not be as fast-paced as videogames, boardgames can provide a more rounded social experience, as friends, and even family members, can meet up to play a game together.

Through boardgames, we can also expand our worldview and learn about different cultures and customs. 

One such example is the popular game “Settlers of Catan”, which was inspired by the history of Icelandic Vikings. Learn more about the history of “Settlers of Catan” in this video:

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niTSTcZkriA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

However, the hobby can be expensive – a single boardgame in Singapore often costs more than $20 per game. 

One great alternative is Print-and-Play boardgames. As its name suggests, Print-and-Play boardgames are games that can be printed and assembled at home. 

Many boardgame companies put up Print-and-Play versions of their boardgames online for public use, and the best part is that it is completely free!

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-pnp-materials.png" alt="All you will need is: a computer and a printer, paper, scissors, glue, cardboard, [optional] Card sleeves and a set of dice (You can get these from a local boardgame store!)" style="width: 70%;">

Once you have the materials above, all you need to do then is pick a game, print it out, and follow the instructions to assemble the boardgame. 

The assembling process can make for a fun time of social bonding if you ask your friends or family to help as well. Before long, you will have a completely assembled boardgame that’s ready to play!

Here are 3 websites that provide great Print-and-Play boardgames:

**1) Asmodee Print & Play**<br>

That’s how Otherworld traps you. It introduces you to sensations you’d never be able to feel in real life. You discover what’s been missing—because it’s taboo or illegal or because you lack the guts to do it for real. And when you find out what’s missing, it’s almost impossible to let it go again.
 
There are no screens. There are no controls. You don’t just see and hear it—you taste, smell, and touch it too. In this new reality, there are no laws to break or rules to obey. You can live your best life. Indulge every desire.
 
This is Otherworld—a virtual reality game so addictive you’ll never want it to end. And Simon has just discovered that for some, it might not.

<a name="id11">![Urban Farming header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-uf.png)</a>
#### **Urban Farming: Back to Our Roots**

Did you know that there are food farms in Singapore? They often grow leafy vegetables and rear fish, chickens, and goats. The farms are mostly located in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Tengah, and occupy less than 1% of Singapore’s total land area (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019).
 
A small country like Singapore imports over 90% of its food from other countries (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019). Yet in recent years, Singapore has been inventive in urban agriculture so that we can produce more of our own food. Being able to sustainably grow food is also linked in many ways to the health of the planet.
 
Maybe you have always aspired to be a farmer, or at the least, have green fingers. If you want to grow your own food, you can always start at home with your own spice garden.
 
You can also go a step further to experiment with hydroponics, like this Singaporean teenager Hanna Joe did. Click on the image below to watch how she created her own mini urban farm at home! *(Please note that the video is only available for viewing on YouTube.)*

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57HBTpEn7KQ&ab_channel=TheStraitsTimes"><img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-uf-vid1.png" alt="YouTube screenshot hyperlinked to Teen grows sustainable hydroponics farm at home video" style="width: 60%;">

<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Adapted from: <a href="https://www.verticalroots.com/the-what-and-why-of-hydroponic-farming/">"The What and Why of Hydroponic Farming", Vertical Roots</a>.</sup></p>

If you’re hesitant to take care of real plants, why not try your hand at virtual farming first with this game by National Geographic:

<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Image source: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/interactive/top-crop/">Top Crop, an interactive game by National Geographic</a>.</sup></p>

Of course, the best place to go for advice on farming is to those with experience themselves. Why not stop by one of Singapore’s farms with your friends and have a chat with an urban farmer or even attend a masterclass on organic farming? Head down to one of Singapore’s best farms as listed in TimeOut’s article:

When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba’s tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season’s crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family’s life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William’s windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land.

**The Thing with Feathers**<br>
By McCall Hoyle<br>
Publisher: Blink, 2017<br>
This eBook is available on [OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/3378108). 

Emilie Day believes in playing it safe: she’s homeschooled, her best friend is her seizure dog, and she’s probably the only girl on the Outer Banks of North Carolina who can’t swim. Then Emilie’s mom enrolls her in public school, and Emilie goes from studying at home in her pj’s to halls full of strangers. To make matters worse, Emilie is paired with starting point guard Chatham York for a major research project on Emily Dickinson. She should be ecstatic when Chatham shows interest, but she has a problem. She hasn’t told anyone about her epilepsy. Emilie lives in fear her recently adjusted meds will fail and she’ll seize at school. Eventually, the worst happens, and she must decide whether to withdraw to safety or follow a dead poet’s advice and “dwell in possibility.”

#### **Think Green, Go Green!**

Engage with the world around you and pick up eco-friendly habits by repurposing the things you already have. Become part of a global initiative to combat climate change by making small lifestyle changes and adopting greener practices.

It’s often difficult to know where to begin, and you may feel like a small seed whose efforts make little difference. Don’t be discouraged! There are many things you can do, and most importantly, it is to get started.

Here are some resources to help you develop environmental mindfulness ☺️

**Part 1: Reconnect with Nature - Forest Bathing**<br>
Known as shinrin-yoku, forest bathing does not actually involve any bathing. Instead, it is an opportunity for you to leave your tech behind, and spend some quiet time immersed in nature. Learn more about forest bathing and its benefits through this video below:

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12CCjoixpkA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Source: [The Art and Science of Forest Bathing with Dr Qing Li, Penguin Books UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12CCjoixpkA&ab_channel=PenguinBooksUK).

Here are some simple steps to forest bathe in urban Singapore, so you can take a short breather from your hectic schedules and connect with the world around you:

* Choose a park with some trees near your home. Remember to pack water and food, and inform your parents/guardian on your whereabouts before leaving home.
* Immerse yourself in your surroundings as you wander around the park for at least 15 minutes.
* Listen to the sounds around you, look at the shapes of the leaves on the trees, and feel the sensation of the ground beneath your feet.
* If you are with someone, resist talking until the end of the walk.
* Self-reflect after your walk. How did you feel? What did you experience?

When seventeen-year-old Ishmael wakes up from stasis aboard the Pequod, he is amazed by how different this planet is from the dirty, dying, Shroud-covered Earth he left behind. But Ishmael isn’t on Cretacea to marvel at the fresh air, sunshine, and endless blue ocean. He’s here to work, risking his life to hunt down great ocean-dwelling beasts to harvest and send back to the resource-depleted Earth.
