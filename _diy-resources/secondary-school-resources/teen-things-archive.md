<a name="id20">![Science in Ancient Egypt header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-ae.png)</a>
#### **Science in Ancient Egypt**

It is easy to believe that ancient civilisations had little understanding of the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), when we hear stories from their time where for example, people believed the Sun moved around the Earth. 

However, the wonders and impressive cultural artefacts that have been left behind show a different story, and are evidence of some great thinkers who applied strong STEM principles.
 
The Pyramids of Giza is one of the most impressive engineering marvels from Ancient Egypt. 

Standing proudly against the sandy backdrop of the Western Desert in the city of Giza, these massive structures of limestone were assembled almost 4,600 years ago using simple machines. 

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-ae1.png" alt="Graphic of pyramids" style="width: 70%;">

And the wonders don’t stop there; within the pyramids are passage systems leading to chambers and grottoes that house the mummified remains of royalty, as well as priceless treasures and art. 

But, you don’t have to set off on an expedition to look into the pyramids. 

Take a guided trip through the twisting passageways of the Great Pyramid of Giza right from the comfort of your own home in this 360-degree video by the BBC. Click and drag the video around to check out every nook and cranny of the pyramid!

Before a body could be laid to rest in these magnificent pyramids, they needed to be mummified. To do so, embalmers in Ancient Egypt used basic scientific principles of osmosis to preserve the bodies. 

After removing the internal organs and setting them aside in jars, the body was packed with natron, a salt found in dried riverbeds (Source: [*How STEM Built the Egyptian Empire* by Xina M. Uhl](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=204129635)). It disinfected and dried out the corpse, keeping it from decaying. 

You can watch this process by conducting a similar experiment with an apple. Follow this step-by-step tutorial by Da Vinci TV to make your very own Apple Mummy.

<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGgntylifmE">Make an Apple Mummy | Xploration DIY SCI, Da Vinci Kids</a>.</sup></p>

Ancient Egyptians also engineered irrigation canals to help grow a variety of plants like barley, onions, garlic, lettuce, and sesame (Source: [*How STEM Built the Egyptian Empire* by Xina M. Uhl](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=204129635)).

However, the most prized plant was the papyrus plant, whose fibres were used to create a type of paper. The stalk was peeled into long strips, and then pressed and dried into sheets. 

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-ae2.png" alt="Graphic of papyrus" style="width: 70%;">

While you may not have easy access to the papyrus plant today, you can create something similar with any clean brown paper bag you might have at home, then use it in a variety of crafts. 

**Make your very own sheet of papyrus!**
<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-ae3.png" alt="1 clean brown paper bag, 1 A4-sized sheet of baking paper or clingwrap, 1 pair of scissors, 1 shallow bowl or tray, 2 tablespoons of white glue, 2 tablespoons of water" style="width: 70%;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><sup>Adapted from: <a href="https://youtu.be/mVN86WKF_Q8">Paper Bag Papyrus, Fitchburg Art Museum</a>.</sup></p>

**Steps:**<br>
**1.** Using the scissors, cut up the clean paper bag into 2cm-wide strips.<br><br>
**2.** Mix the two tablespoons of water with the two tablespoons of white glue.<br><br>
**3.** Dip each strip into the water and glue mixture.<br><br>
**4.** Lay the strips down horizontally onto the baking paper or clingwrap. Make sure the strips overlap slightly. Smooth them out as you go.<br><br>
**5.** Once the horizontal strips reach the length you want your paper to be, start laying the strips vertically on top of the horizontal strips.<br><br>
**6.** Let dry overnight and the next day, you will have a beautiful papyrus-like sheet of paper!<br>

**The finished product!**

**Music: A Very Short Introduction**<br>
Author: Nicholas Cook<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press, 2021<br>
Only available as an eBook on [NLB OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/6081119). 

The world teems with different kinds of music—traditional, folk, classical, jazz, rock, pop—and each type of music tends to come with its own way of thinking. Drawing on a wealth of accessible examples ranging from Beethoven to Chinese zither music, this *Very Short Introduction* considers the history of music and thinking about music, focusing on its social and cultural dimensions. 

In this new edition Cook explores the impact of digital technology on the production and consumption of music, including how it has transformed participatory music-making and the music business. He also discusses music's position in a globalized world, from the role it played in historical processes of colonisation and decolonisation to its present-day significance as a vehicle of cross-cultural communication.

<a name="id18">![Fermentation Station header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-ferm.png)</a>
#### **Fermentation Station: Food Around Us**

Mould, yeast, and bacteria—three must-have ingredients to create a delicious meal! 

Whether it’s that fragrant egg and onion *thosai* (savoury thin pancake) you had for supper, or a mouth-watering bowl of *suan cai yu* (pickled fish stew) from your favourite stall, many things we consume daily are made with the help of microorganisms. 

Fortunately, these foods are perfectly safe. They’ve simply undergone a biochemical process known as **fermentation**. 

Fermentation occurs when microorganisms react with carbohydrate sources in an oxygen-free (or anaerobic) environment (Source: [Cravings of a Food Scientist](https://cravingsofafoodscientist.com/2019/04/30/how-fermentation-makes-food-delicious/), 2019). 

Mould, yeast, and bacteria break sugars and starches down into acids or alcohols, creating fermented foods which have a particular taste and texture.

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Glucose + Microorganisms in an environment without oxygen and acid/alcohol + carbon dioxide" src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-f1.png">
<p style="text-align: center;"><sup><i>Fermentation: Carbohydrate Source + Microorganism - Oxygen = Acid/Alcohol + Carbon Dioxide</i><br>Adapted from: <a href="https://cravingsofafoodscientist.com/2019/04/30/how-fermentation-makes-food-delicious/">"How Fermentation Makes Food Delicious", Cravings of a Food Scientist</a>.</sup></p>

Kimchi, a popular Korean side dish, is one of such foods. In particular, it’s created through a common type of fermentation known as lacto-fermentation (Source: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lacto-fermentation#how-it-works), 2019). 

With lactic acid as a byproduct, food becomes increasingly acidic, and the surrounding air more anaerobic.

Take a look at how this tangy dish is made, and try identifying the elements involved in the chemical reaction. Which microorganisms are present? What are the carbohydrate sources being broken down?

You’ve probably seen many other fermented foods like kombucha and sourdough popping up on your feed. But fermentation isn’t just a fad—it’s been around since the Neolithic period, which spanned 10,000 to 4,500 BCE. (Source: [Tamang](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12520), 2020).

Kombucha, for example, was first brewed by a physician in Northeast China! Popularised for its supposed medicinal benefits, the drink quickly made its way across the globe. (Source: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinatroitino/2017/02/01/kombucha-101-demystifying-the-past-present-and-future-of-the-fermented-tea-drink/?sh=2a8148644ae2), 2017).

Delve into the history of fermentation with this video. Discover how our tastebuds evolved through centuries to enjoy the sour and umami flavours of fermented foods.

These days, the online fermentation community is huge. From the trending fermented honey garlic recipe on TikTok, to people showing off their [SCOBY hotels](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeypbC7Y/) (SCOBY stands for “symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast”, a fundamental ingredient in making fermented foods like kombucha!), the experimentation with food never stops.

If Bao Nguyen had to describe himself, he’d say he was a rock. Steady and strong, but not particularly interesting. His grades are average, his social status unremarkable. He works at his parents’ pho restaurant, and even there, he is his parents’ fifth favourite employee. Not ideal.

If Linh Mai had to describe herself, she’d say she was a firecracker. Stable when unlit, but full of potential for joy and fire. She loves art and dreams pursuing a career in it. The only problem? Her parents rely on her in ways they’re not willing to admit, including working practically full-time at her family’s pho restaurant.

For years, the Mais and the Nguyens have been at odds, having owned competing, neighboring pho restaurants. Bao and Linh, who’ve avoided each other for most of their lives, both suspect that the feud stems from feelings much deeper than friendly competition.

But then a chance encounter brings Linh and Bao in the same vicinity despite their best efforts and sparks fly, leading them both to wonder what took so long for them to connect. But then, of course, they immediately remember.

Can Linh and Bao find love in the midst of feuding families and complicated histories?

<a name="id17">![Emailing 101 header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-email.png)</a>
#### **Emailing 101**
So you’ve just been assigned to send an email to an organisation for a school project or a Values in Action (VIA) programme, or maybe you have to apply for an internship. 

You might have crafted a couple of emails to your friends or teachers before, but you aren’t quite sure what exactly goes into such formal emails.&nbsp;

Well, don’t worry—we’re here to help you out! Here are some tips and tricks on writing effective emails that are sure to impress.

**Part 1: Email Subject**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
This tells people what your email is about at a quick glance. Don’t underestimate its importance—spam filters in your inbox also use this to determine if the email is spam or not!

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Clearly indicate and specify your objective. Refrain from having a long email subject, as the end may get cut off. Example: Collaboration with NLB." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e3.png">

**Part 2: To/Cc/Bcc**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
This is the most important part—your emails need to be sent successfully to the correct recipients! 

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Double-check that all email addresses are correct! The To field is where your recipient’s email address should be. Use the CC field to keep your teachers and groupmates in the loop. If you have sensitive contact details that you do not wish to share with others in the email, use the “BCC” field to keep them unseen." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e1.png">

**Part 3: Salutation**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Always greet your recipient politely—if you sound rude from the start, your recipient may treat your email as spam.  

If your recipient signs off with a particular name, do take note to address them with their preferred name in future correspondences. 

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Address your email’s recipient if you know their identity. If you do not know the identity of your email’s recipient, feel free to address them with Dear Sir/Mdm. Check that the recipient’s name is spelt correctly before sending your email to avoid offending them. Example: Dear Sir/Mdm," src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e2.png">

**Part 4: Introduction**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Put yourself in your recipient’s shoes—if you receive an anonymous email, it is likely that you would only spare it a cursory glance, or worse, delete it.

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Provide a brief introduction about yourself and the objective(s) of writing the email. Example: I am Jayden from Teens Takeover Secondary School, and I am writing on behalf of my project team regarding a collaboration with the library." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e4.png">

**Part 5: Body**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
This forms the bulk of your email. Here is where you tell people the details of what you need, and how you’re proposing for it to happen. 

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Keep your email simple and to the point. Many people are busy and don’t have the time to read long essays about your proposal. Consider using bullet points for easy reading. Write all abbreviations in full the first time it’s being mentioned in the email e.g. National Library Board (NLB). Use paragraphs to space out dense emails. You may use headers to section your email. Example: My team and I would like to set up a display in the library about hydroponics. Here are the details: Date of set-up: 31 October 2021. Date of tear-down: 30 November 2021. Preferred library:&nbsp;Jurong West Public Library. Target audience: Teens 13-19 years old. What we will be putting up: 4 A3-sized posterboards. The content of our posters include the history of hydroponics in Singapore, a how-to set-up guide, as well as a photo feature of local spaces with hydroponics." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e5.png">

**Part 6: Conclusion**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Summarise your request so that the recipient is reminded about what they can assist you with. 
Use this opportunity to let the recipient know how to get in touch with you if they need further details.

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Briefly summarise your request, and include your deadline where necessary. Emphasise any details of note by bolding or underlining the text so it stands out from the rest of the paragraph. (But don’t bold and underline too much! Just one or two keywords will do). Example: We would appreciate being able to put up this display in the library. As our project deadline is approaching, please let us know if this collaboration will be possible by&nbsp;30 January 2022. Do let us know if there is more information we can provide. Otherwise, we hope to hear from you soon! Thank you." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e6.png">

**Part 7: Signing off**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
End your email politely. Some sign-offs you may use include phrases such as “**Thank you**”, “**Regards**”, “**Warmest Regards**”, and “**Best Wishes**”.

The sign off also reiterates to your recipient your preferred name to be addressed by, even if you have introduced yourself earlier.

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: A standard email signature can be useful for adding formality to your email. This can be easily set up in your email account. Differentiate your first and last name so your recipient won’t be confused. You may underline your preferred name too. Avoid including personal information that you do not want to share with others. Example: Regards, Jayden. Jayden Lim. Teens Takeover Secondary School. Secondary 3A." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e7.png">

**Part 8: Attachments**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Sending in a preview of your content as an attachment will help your recipient visualise your request better.

<img style="width: 70%;" alt="Tips: Indicate in the email that you’ve added an attachment and what it is for. Check that the attachment is correct. Try to compress your files to prevent overly large emails that would take up your recipient’s inbox space. Some email clients may not be able to deliver oversized files. Example: I’ve attached a sample of the poster in this email for your reference." src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e8.png">

Finally, there are a couple of things to take note of:
* Re-read your email before sending it. If it helps, get another person to look at your email to catch any errors.
* Avoid using emojis in your initial email. While using emojis is the norm in your group chats, it may be seen as unprofessional and may cause your recipient to think you are not serious. 

Once you’re done, click send!

#### **Deep Dive into Marine Biodiversity**
*Biodiversity.* It’s a term we see in our science textbooks, but what exactly is it? 

We’ve put together some resources to help you understand how biodiversity is intimately related to our daily lives and learn how we can continue to care for the world around us.

<b><u>Part 1: Explore biodiversity from your bedroom</u></b><br>
Watch this animation by the Natural History Museum of London to learn what biodiversity is about.

As you can see, biodiversity can be quite broad! Let’s take a closer look at coastal biodiversity, which refers to the plants and animals near or in the sea.

For a deeper dive into more information, events, and projects on biodiversity in Singapore, check out [wildsingapore's website](http://www.wildsingapore.com/).


<b><u>Part 2: Immerse yourself in nature and get inspired</u></b><br>
Grab a friend and take a walk along a coastal trail in Singapore! Here are some suggestions for where you can go:

**Tips for a comfortable coastal walk**

**Tip 1: Do your research**<br>
Before heading off, double-check the location, opening hours, and entrance fees (if any). Bring water and an umbrella, and always inform an adult of your whereabouts.


**Tip 2: Be present and stay alert**<br>
Keep an eye on your surroundings—take in the ground, vegetation, and water bodies around you. 

Listen for any sounds too! We often rely on our sight but the most surprising finds can come from your other senses. 

**Tip 3: Observe the details**<br>
If you pay attention, the small things will reveal themselves—from flowers and fruit in the bushes, the salty smell of the sea and seaweed, to even animals moving around in the trees or in the water. 

All of these form Singapore’s biodiversity in one way or another!

**Tip 4: Reflect and clean up**<br>
After your walk, take some time to think, discuss your observations with a friend, or take to journaling. Make sure to dispose of any trash properly before leaving. 


<b><u>Part 3: Get involved!</u></b><br>
Now that you’ve learnt a bit more, get further involved and updated with biodiversity matters! 

Here are some ways you can do so:
* Join a citizen science programme. Participate in a community research project to observe natural spaces and collect data. The information you collect will be further studied to make an impact on conservation strategies in Singapore. Find out more about [NPark’s Citizen Science Programmes](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative/citizen-science-programmes). 
* Volunteer with non-profits. Put your skills towards a good cause with non-profit organisations that might need help with graphic design, copywriting, or running events. Some organisations you can check out are [International Coastal Cleanup Singapore](coastalcleanup.nus.edu.sg/) and [Waterways Watch Society](https://www.wws.org.sg/). 
* Reduce plastic use. Plastic pollution is a big threat to biodiversity. In the oceans, plastic poses a danger to unsuspecting wildlife. If you’re able to, bring your own reusable bags and containers, and take small steps to ensure that plastic waste is recycled or disposed of responsibly. 

<b><u>Part 4: Stay updated!</u></b><br>
**Social media**<br>
Here are some Instagram accounts that aren’t just about cute animals or breath-taking natural scenery – they also provide some food for thought on how we can better appreciate and help biodiversity around us, both local and globally:

| <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coastalnatives.sg"><img style="width: 80%;" alt="@coastalnatives.sg on Instagram" src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mb-ig1.png"></a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naturesocietysingapore"><img style="width: 80%;" alt="@naturesocietysingapore on Instagram" src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mb-ig2.png"></a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcearth"><img style="width: 80%;" alt="@bbcearth on Instagram" src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mb-ig3.png"></a> |

Containing 97 percent of Earth’s water supply, the ocean plays a huge role in regulating global temperatures, supporting plant and animal life, and contributing to the livelihoods of millions of people. But in spite of all this, the ocean remains drastically unexplored, and the details of its impact on human lives aren’t fully understood.

Every day, mysteries about the ocean are being solved, and every day, new questions come to light. The more scientists learn, the better they are able to answer these new questions.

What lies in the deep? And who is at the forefront of these exciting discoveries? The scientists and research included in this book shed light on the most pressing issues currently facing oceanographers and point us in the right direction to solving these challenges.

#### **D.I.Y. Blackout Poetry**

Blackout poetry is a form of poetry where an author picks an existing piece of written text to repurpose into a new poem. 

This is done by keeping a selection of words, and blacking out the remaining words you do not want. The result gives the written text a different meaning than it had before.

There are various ways you can craft a blackout poem, from simply using a single black marker to creating a vibrant and colourful work of art using paint.

Rowena feels like her family is a frayed string of lights that someone needs to fix with electrical tape. After her mother died a few years ago, she and her sister, Ariana, drifted into their own corners of the world, each figuring out in their own separate ways how to exist in a world in which their mother is no longer alive.

But then Ariana disappears under the cover of night in the middle of a snowstorm, leaving no trace or tracks. When Row wakes up to a world of snow and her sister’s empty bedroom, she is left to piece together the mystery behind where Ariana went and why, realizing along the way that she might be part of the reason Ariana is gone.

<a name="id12">![Print-and-Play Boardgames header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-pnp.png)</a>
#### **Print-and-Play Boardgames**

“Boardgaming” has become an increasingly popular hobby in recent years, often seen as a throwback to the days before online gaming.

While they may not be as fast-paced as videogames, boardgames can provide a more rounded social experience, as friends, and even family members, can meet up to play a game together.

Through boardgames, we can also expand our worldview and learn about different cultures and customs. 

One such example is the popular game “Settlers of Catan”, which was inspired by the history of Icelandic Vikings. Learn more about the history of “Settlers of Catan” in this video:

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niTSTcZkriA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

However, the hobby can be expensive – a single boardgame in Singapore often costs more than $20 per game. 

One great alternative is Print-and-Play boardgames. As its name suggests, Print-and-Play boardgames are games that can be printed and assembled at home. 

Many boardgame companies put up Print-and-Play versions of their boardgames online for public use, and the best part is that it is completely free!

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-pnp-materials.png" alt="All you will need is: a computer and a printer, paper, scissors, glue, cardboard, [optional] Card sleeves and a set of dice (You can get these from a local boardgame store!)" style="width: 70%;">

Once you have the materials above, all you need to do then is pick a game, print it out, and follow the instructions to assemble the boardgame. 

The assembling process can make for a fun time of social bonding if you ask your friends or family to help as well. Before long, you will have a completely assembled boardgame that’s ready to play!

Here are 3 websites that provide great Print-and-Play boardgames:

**1) Asmodee Print & Play**<br>

That’s how Otherworld traps you. It introduces you to sensations you’d never be able to feel in real life. You discover what’s been missing—because it’s taboo or illegal or because you lack the guts to do it for real. And when you find out what’s missing, it’s almost impossible to let it go again.
 
There are no screens. There are no controls. You don’t just see and hear it—you taste, smell, and touch it too. In this new reality, there are no laws to break or rules to obey. You can live your best life. Indulge every desire.
 
This is Otherworld—a virtual reality game so addictive you’ll never want it to end. And Simon has just discovered that for some, it might not.

<a name="id11">![Urban Farming header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-uf.png)</a>
#### **Urban Farming: Back to Our Roots**

Did you know that there are food farms in Singapore? They often grow leafy vegetables and rear fish, chickens, and goats. The farms are mostly located in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Tengah, and occupy less than 1% of Singapore’s total land area (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019).
 
A small country like Singapore imports over 90% of its food from other countries (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019). Yet in recent years, Singapore has been inventive in urban agriculture so that we can produce more of our own food. Being able to sustainably grow food is also linked in many ways to the health of the planet.
 
Maybe you have always aspired to be a farmer, or at the least, have green fingers. If you want to grow your own food, you can always start at home with your own spice garden.
 
You can also go a step further to experiment with hydroponics, like this Singaporean teenager Hanna Joe did. Click on the image below to watch how she created her own mini urban farm at home! *(Please note that the video is only available for viewing on YouTube.)*

If you’re hesitant to take care of real plants, why not try your hand at virtual farming first with this game by National Geographic:

Of course, the best place to go for advice on farming is to those with experience themselves. Why not stop by one of Singapore’s farms with your friends and have a chat with an urban farmer or even attend a masterclass on organic farming? Head down to one of Singapore’s best farms as listed in TimeOut’s article:

When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba’s tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season’s crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family’s life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William’s windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land.

By McCall Hoyle<br>
Publisher: Blink, 2017<br>
This eBook is available on [OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/3378108). 

Emilie Day believes in playing it safe: she’s homeschooled, her best friend is her seizure dog, and she’s probably the only girl on the Outer Banks of North Carolina who can’t swim. Then Emilie’s mom enrolls her in public school, and Emilie goes from studying at home in her pj’s to halls full of strangers. To make matters worse, Emilie is paired with starting point guard Chatham York for a major research project on Emily Dickinson. She should be ecstatic when Chatham shows interest, but she has a problem. She hasn’t told anyone about her epilepsy. Emilie lives in fear her recently adjusted meds will fail and she’ll seize at school. Eventually, the worst happens, and she must decide whether to withdraw to safety or follow a dead poet’s advice and “dwell in possibility.”

#### **Think Green, Go Green!**

Engage with the world around you and pick up eco-friendly habits by repurposing the things you already have. Become part of a global initiative to combat climate change by making small lifestyle changes and adopting greener practices.

It’s often difficult to know where to begin, and you may feel like a small seed whose efforts make little difference. Don’t be discouraged! There are many things you can do, and most importantly, it is to get started.

Here are some resources to help you develop environmental mindfulness ☺️

**Part 1: Reconnect with Nature - Forest Bathing**<br>
Known as shinrin-yoku, forest bathing does not actually involve any bathing. Instead, it is an opportunity for you to leave your tech behind, and spend some quiet time immersed in nature. Learn more about forest bathing and its benefits through this video below:

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12CCjoixpkA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Source: [The Art and Science of Forest Bathing with Dr Qing Li, Penguin Books UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12CCjoixpkA&ab_channel=PenguinBooksUK).

Here are some simple steps to forest bathe in urban Singapore, so you can take a short breather from your hectic schedules and connect with the world around you:

* Choose a park with some trees near your home. Remember to pack water and food, and inform your parents/guardian on your whereabouts before leaving home.
* Immerse yourself in your surroundings as you wander around the park for at least 15 minutes.
* Listen to the sounds around you, look at the shapes of the leaves on the trees, and feel the sensation of the ground beneath your feet.
* If you are with someone, resist talking until the end of the walk.
* Self-reflect after your walk. How did you feel? What did you experience?

By Todd Strasser<br>
Publisher: Candlewick, 2015<br>
This eBook is available on [OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/2397149).

Master storyteller Todd Strasser reimagines the classic tale of Moby Dick as set in the future - and takes readers on an epic sci-fi adventure.
When seventeen-year-old Ishmael wakes up from stasis aboard the Pequod, he is amazed by how different this planet is from the dirty, dying, Shroud-covered Earth he left behind. But Ishmael isn’t on Cretacea to marvel at the fresh air, sunshine, and endless blue ocean. He’s here to work, risking his life to hunt down great ocean-dwelling beasts to harvest and send back to the resource-depleted Earth.
