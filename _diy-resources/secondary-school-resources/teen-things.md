#### **Deep Dive into Marine Biodiversity**
*Biodiversity.* It’s a term we see in our science textbooks, but what exactly is it? 

We’ve put together some resources to help you understand how biodiversity is intimately related to our daily lives and learn how we can continue to care for the world around us.

<b><u>Part 1: Explore biodiversity from your bedroom</u></b><br>
Watch this animation by the Natural History Museum of London to learn what biodiversity is about.

As you can see, biodiversity can be quite broad! Let’s take a closer look at coastal biodiversity, which refers to the plants and animals near or in the sea.

For a deeper dive into more information, events, and projects on biodiversity in Singapore, check out [wildsingapore's website](http://www.wildsingapore.com/).


<b><u>Part 2: Immerse yourself in nature and get inspired</u></b><br>
Grab a friend and take a walk along a coastal trail in Singapore! Here are some suggestions for where you can go:

**Tips for a comfortable coastal walk**

**Tip 1: Do your research**<br>
Before heading off, double-check the location, opening hours, and entrance fees (if any). Bring water and an umbrella, and always inform an adult of your whereabouts.


**Tip 2: Be present and stay alert**<br>
Keep an eye on your surroundings – take in the ground, vegetation, and water bodies around you. 

Listen for any sounds too! We often rely on our sight but the most surprising finds can come from your other senses. 

**Tip 3: Observe the details**<br>
If you pay attention, the small things will reveal themselves – from flowers and fruit in the bushes, the salty smell of the sea and seaweed, to even animals moving around in the trees or in the water. 

All of these form Singapore’s biodiversity in one way or another!

**Tip 4: Reflect and clean up**<br>
After your walk, take some time to think, discuss your observations with a friend, or take to journaling. Make sure to dispose of any trash properly before leaving. 


<b><u>Part 3: Get involved!</u></b><br>
Now that you’ve learnt a bit more, get further involved and updated with biodiversity matters! 

Here are some ways you can do so:
* Join a citizen science programme. Participate in a community research project to observe natural spaces and collect data. The information you collect will be further studied to make an impact on conservation strategies in Singapore. Find out more about [NPark’s Citizen Science Programmes](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative/citizen-science-programmes). 
* Volunteer with non-profits. Put your skills towards a good cause with non-profit organisations that might need help with graphic design, copywriting, or running events. Some organisations you can check out are [International Coastal Cleanup Singapore](coastalcleanup.nus.edu.sg/) and [Waterways Watch Society](https://www.wws.org.sg/). 
* Reduce plastic use. Plastic pollution is a big threat to biodiversity. In the oceans, plastic poses a danger to unsuspecting wildlife. If you’re able to, bring your own reusable bags and containers, and take small steps to ensure that plastic waste is recycled or disposed of responsibly. 

<b><u>Part 4: Stay updated!</u></b><br>
**Social media**<br>
Here are some Instagram accounts that aren’t just about cute animals or breath-taking natural scenery – they also provide some food for thought on how we can better appreciate and help biodiversity around us, both local and globally:

| <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coastalnatives.sg"><img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mb-ig1.png" alt="@coastalnatives.sg on Instagram" style="width: 80%;"></a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naturesocietysingapore"><img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mb-ig2.png" alt="@naturesocietysingapore on Instagram" style="width: 80%;"></a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcearth"><img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-mb-ig3.png" alt="@bbcearth on Instagram" style="width: 80%;"></a> | 

If you’re interested to further engage with sustainability and local conservation efforts, these Instagram accounts may just provide that extra green on your feed:

Author: Christy Peterson<br>
Call No.: Y 551.46 PET<br>
Publisher: Twenty-First Century Books, 2020<br> 
Also available as an eBook on [NLB OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/library/teens/media/5129216). 

Containing 97 percent of Earth’s water supply, the ocean plays a huge role in regulating global temperatures, supporting plant and animal life, and contributing to the livelihoods of millions of people. But in spite of all this, the ocean remains drastically unexplored, and the details of its impact on human lives aren’t fully understood.

Every day, mysteries about the ocean are being solved, and every day, new questions come to light. The more scientists learn, the better they are able to answer these new questions.

What lies in the deep? And who is at the forefront of these exciting discoveries? The scientists and research included in this book shed light on the most pressing issues currently facing oceanographers and point us in the right direction to solving these challenges.
