#### **Urban Farming: Back to Our Roots**

Did you know that there are food farms in Singapore? They often grow leafy vegetables and rear fish, chickens, and goats. The farms are mostly located in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Tengah, and occupy less than 1% of Singapore’s total land area (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019).
 
A small country like Singapore imports over 90% of its food from other countries (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019). Yet in recent years, Singapore has been inventive in urban agriculture so that we can produce more of our own food. Being able to sustainably grow food is also linked in many ways to the health of the planet.
 
Maybe you have always aspired to be a farmer, or at the least, have green fingers. If you want to grow your own food, you can always start at home with your own spice garden.
 
You can also go a step further to experiment with hydroponics, like this Singaporean teenager Hanna Joe did. Check out how she created her own mini urban farm at home with this video:

If you’re hesitant to take care of real plants, why not try your hand at virtual farming first with this game by National Geographic:

Of course, the best place to go for advice on farming is to those with experience themselves. Why not stop by one of Singapore’s farms with your friends and have a chat with an urban farmer or even attend a masterclass on organic farming? Head down to one of Singapore’s best farms as listed in TimeOut’s article:

When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba’s tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season’s crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family’s life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William’s windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land.
