#### **Print-and-Play Boardgames**

“Boardgaming” has become an increasingly popular hobby in recent years, often seen as a throwback to the days before online gaming. While they may not be as fast-paced as videogames, boardgames can provide a more rounded social experience, as friends, and even family members, can meet up to play a game together.

Through boardgames, we can also expand our worldview and learn about different cultures and customs. One such example is the popular game “Settlers of Catan”, which was inspired by the history of Icelandic Vikings.

Learn more about the history of “Settlers of Catan” in this video:

However, the hobby can be expensive – a single boardgame in Singapore often costs more than $20 per game. One great alternative is Print-and-Play boardgames. As its name suggests, Print-and-Play boardgames are games that can be printed and assembled at home. Many boardgame companies put up Print-and-Play versions of their boardgames online for public use, and the best part is that it is completely free!

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-pnp-materials.png" alt="All you will need is: a computer and a printer, paper, scissors, glue, cardboard, [optional] Card sleeves and a set of dice (You can get these from a local boardgame store!)" style="width: 70%;">

Once you have the materials above, all you need to do then is pick a game, print it out, and follow the instructions to assemble the boardgame. The assembly process can make for a fun time of social bonding if you ask your friends or family to help as well. Before long, you will have a completely assembled boardgame that’s ready to play!

Publisher: Rock the Boat, 2017<br>

That’s how Otherworld traps you. It introduces you to sensations you’d never be able to feel in real life. You discover what’s been missing—because it’s taboo or illegal or because you lack the guts to do it for real. And when you find out what’s missing, it’s almost impossible to let it go again.
 
There are no screens. There are no controls. You don’t just see and hear it—you taste, smell, and touch it too. In this new reality, there are no laws to break or rules to obey. You can live your best life. Indulge every desire.
 
This is Otherworld—a virtual reality game so addictive you’ll never want it to end. And Simon has just discovered that for some, it might not.

#### **Urban Farming: Back to Our Roots**

Did you know that there are food farms in Singapore? They often grow leafy vegetables and rear fish, chickens, and goats. The farms are mostly located in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Tengah, and occupy less than 1% of Singapore’s total land area (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019).
 
A small country like Singapore imports over 90% of its food from other countries (Source: [Singapore Food Agency](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-farming/food-farms/farming-in-singapore), 2019). Yet in recent years, Singapore has been inventive in urban agriculture so that we can produce more of our own food. Being able to sustainably grow food is also linked in many ways to the health of the planet.
 
Maybe you have always aspired to be a farmer, or at the least, have green fingers. If you want to grow your own food, you can always start at home with your own spice garden.
 
You can also go a step further to experiment with hydroponics, like this Singaporean teenager Hanna Joe did. Check out how she created her own mini urban farm at home with this video:

If you’re hesitant to take care of real plants, why not try your hand at virtual farming first with this game by National Geographic:

Of course, the best place to go for advice on farming is to those with experience themselves. Why not stop by one of Singapore’s farms with your friends and have a chat with an urban farmer or even attend a masterclass on organic farming? Head down to one of Singapore’s best farms as listed in TimeOut’s article:

When a terrible drought struck William Kamkwamba’s tiny village in Malawi, his family lost all of the season’s crops, leaving them with nothing to eat and nothing to sell. William began to explore science books in his village library, looking for a solution. There, he came up with the idea that would change his family’s life forever: he could build a windmill. Made out of scrap metal and old bicycle parts, William’s windmill brought electricity to his home and helped his family pump the water they needed to farm the land.
