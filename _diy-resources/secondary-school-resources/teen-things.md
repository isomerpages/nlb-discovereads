#### **Fermentation Station: Food Around Us**

Mould, yeast, and bacteria—three must-have ingredients to create a delicious meal! 

Whether it’s that fragrant egg and onion *thosai* (savoury thin pancake) you had for supper, or a mouth-watering bowl of *suan cai yu* (pickled fish stew) from your favourite stall, many things we consume daily are made with the help of microorganisms. 

Fortunately, these foods are perfectly safe. They’ve simply undergone a biochemical process known as **fermentation**. 

Fermentation occurs when microorganisms react with carbohydrate sources in an oxygen-free (or anaerobic) environment (Source: [Cravings of a Food Scientist](https://cravingsofafoodscientist.com/2019/04/30/how-fermentation-makes-food-delicious/), 2019). 

Mould, yeast, and bacteria break sugars and starches down into acids or alcohols, creating fermented foods which have a particular taste and texture.

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-f1.png" alt="Glucose + Microorganisms in an environment without oxygen and acid/alcohol + carbon dioxide" style="width: 70%;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><sup><i>Fermentation: Carbohydrate Source + Microorganism - Oxygen = Acid/Alcohol + Carbon Dioxide</i><br>Adapted from: <a href="https://cravingsofafoodscientist.com/2019/04/30/how-fermentation-makes-food-delicious/">"How Fermentation Makes Food Delicious", Cravings of a Food Scientist</a>.</sup></p>

Kimchi, a popular Korean side dish, is one of such foods. In particular, it’s created through a common type of fermentation known as lacto-fermentation (Source: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lacto-fermentation#how-it-works), 2019). 

With lactic acid as a byproduct, food becomes increasingly acidic, and the surrounding air more anaerobic.

Take a look at how this tangy dish is made, and try identifying the elements involved in the chemical reaction. Which microorganisms are present? What are the carbohydrate sources being broken down?

You’ve probably seen many other fermented foods like kombucha and sourdough popping up on your feed. But fermentation isn’t just a fad—it’s been around since the Neolithic period, which spanned 10,000 to 4,500 BCE. (Source: [Tamang](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12520), 2020).

Kombucha, for example, was first brewed by a physician in Northeast China! Popularised for its supposed medicinal benefits, the drink quickly made its way across the globe. (Source: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinatroitino/2017/02/01/kombucha-101-demystifying-the-past-present-and-future-of-the-fermented-tea-drink/?sh=2a8148644ae2), 2017).

These days, the online fermentation community is huge. From the trending fermented honey garlic recipe on TikTok, to people showing off their [SCOBY hotels](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeypbC7Y/) (SCOBY stands for “symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast”, a fundamental ingredient in making fermented foods like kombucha!), the experimentation with food never stops.

If Bao Nguyen had to describe himself, he’d say he was a rock. Steady and strong, but not particularly interesting. His grades are average, his social status unremarkable. He works at his parents’ pho restaurant, and even there, he is his parents’ fifth favourite employee. Not ideal.

If Linh Mai had to describe herself, she’d say she was a firecracker. Stable when unlit, but full of potential for joy and fire. She loves art and dreams pursuing a career in it. The only problem? Her parents rely on her in ways they’re not willing to admit, including working practically full-time at her family’s pho restaurant.

For years, the Mais and the Nguyens have been at odds, having owned competing, neighboring pho restaurants. Bao and Linh, who’ve avoided each other for most of their lives, both suspect that the feud stems from feelings much deeper than friendly competition.

But then a chance encounter brings Linh and Bao in the same vicinity despite their best efforts and sparks fly, leading them both to wonder what took so long for them to connect. But then, of course, they immediately remember.

Can Linh and Bao find love in the midst of feuding families and complicated histories?

<a name="id3">![Emailing 101 header](/images/diyresources/secondary/tt21-header-email.png)</a>
#### **Emailing 101**
So you’ve just been assigned to send an email to an organisation for a school project or a Values in Action (VIA) programme, or maybe you have to apply for an internship. 

You might have crafted a couple of emails to your friends or teachers before, but you aren’t quite sure what exactly goes into such formal emails. 

Well, don’t worry—we’re here to help you out! Here are some tips and tricks on writing effective emails that are sure to impress.

**Part 1: Email Subject**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
This tells people what your email is about at a quick glance. Don’t underestimate its importance—spam filters in your inbox also use this to determine if the email is spam or not!

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e3.png" alt="Tips: Clearly indicate and specify your objective. Refrain from having a long email subject, as the end may get cut off. Example: Collaboration with NLB." style="width: 70%;">

**Part 2: To/Cc/Bcc**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
This is the most important part—your emails need to be sent successfully to the correct recipients! 

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e1.png" alt="Tips: Double-check that all email addresses are correct! The To field is where your recipient’s email address should be. Use the CC field to keep your teachers and groupmates in the loop. If you have sensitive contact details that you do not wish to share with others in the email, use the “BCC” field to keep them unseen." style="width: 70%;">

**Part 3: Salutation**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Always greet your recipient politely—if you sound rude from the start, your recipient may treat your email as spam.  

If your recipient signs off with a particular name, do take note to address them with their preferred name in future correspondences. 

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e2.png" alt="Tips: Address your email’s recipient if you know their identity. If you do not know the identity of your email’s recipient, feel free to address them with Dear Sir/Mdm. Check that the recipient’s name is spelt correctly before sending your email to avoid offending them. Example: Dear Sir/Mdm," style="width: 70%;">

**Part 4: Introduction**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Put yourself in your recipient’s shoes—if you receive an anonymous email, it is likely that you would only spare it a cursory glance, or worse, delete it.

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e4.png" alt="Tips: Provide a brief introduction about yourself and the objective(s) of writing the email. Example: I am Jayden from Teens Takeover Secondary School, and I am writing on behalf of my project team regarding a collaboration with the library." style="width: 70%;">

**Part 5: Body**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
This forms the bulk of your email. Here is where you tell people the details of what you need, and how you’re proposing for it to happen. 

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e5.png" alt="Tips: Keep your email simple and to the point. Many people are busy and don’t have the time to read long essays about your proposal. Consider using bullet points for easy reading. Write all abbreviations in full the first time it’s being mentioned in the email e.g. National Library Board (NLB). Use paragraphs to space out dense emails. You may use headers to section your email. Example: My team and I would like to set up a display in the library about hydroponics. Here are the details: Date of set-up: 31 October 2021. Date of tear-down: 30 November 2021. Preferred library: Jurong West Public Library. Target audience: Teens 13-19 years old. What we will be putting up: 4 A3-sized posterboards. The content of our posters include the history of hydroponics in Singapore, a how-to set-up guide, as well as a photo feature of local spaces with hydroponics." style="width: 70%;">

**Part 6: Conclusion**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Summarise your request so that the recipient is reminded about what they can assist you with. 
Use this opportunity to let the recipient know how to get in touch with you if they need further details.

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e6.png" alt="Tips: Briefly summarise your request, and include your deadline where necessary. Emphasise any details of note by bolding or underlining the text so it stands out from the rest of the paragraph. (But don’t bold and underline too much! Just one or two keywords will do). Example: We would appreciate being able to put up this display in the library. As our project deadline is approaching, please let us know if this collaboration will be possible by 30 January 2022. Do let us know if there is more information we can provide. Otherwise, we hope to hear from you soon! Thank you." style="width: 70%;">

**Part 7: Signing off**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
End your email politely. Some sign-offs you may use include phrases such as “**Thank you**”, “**Regards**”, “**Warmest Regards**”, and “**Best Wishes**”.

The sign off also reiterates to your recipient your preferred name to be addressed by, even if you have introduced yourself earlier.

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e7.png" alt="Tips: A standard email signature can be useful for adding formality to your email. This can be easily set up in your email account. Differentiate your first and last name so your recipient won’t be confused. You may underline your preferred name too. Avoid including personal information that you do not want to share with others. Example: Regards, Jayden. Jayden Lim. Teens Takeover Secondary School. Secondary 3A." style="width: 70%;">

**Part 8: Attachments**<br>
<u>Why it should be done well</u><br>
Sending in a preview of your content as an attachment will help your recipient visualise your request better.

<img src="/images/diyresources/secondary/tt-e8.png" alt="Tips: Indicate in the email that you’ve added an attachment and what it is for. Check that the attachment is correct. Try to compress your files to prevent overly large emails that would take up your recipient’s inbox space. Some email clients may not be able to deliver oversized files. Example: I’ve attached a sample of the poster in this email for your reference." style="width: 70%;">

Finally, there are a couple of things to take note of:
* Re-read your email before sending it. If it helps, get another person to look at your email to catch any errors.
* Avoid using emojis in your initial email. While using emojis is the norm in your group chats, it may be seen as unprofessional and may cause your recipient to think you are not serious. 

Once you’re done, click send!

#### **Deep Dive into Marine Biodiversity**
*Biodiversity.* It’s a term we see in our science textbooks, but what exactly is it? 

We’ve put together some resources to help you understand how biodiversity is intimately related to our daily lives and learn how we can continue to care for the world around us.

<b><u>Part 1: Explore biodiversity from your bedroom</u></b><br>

**Tips for a comfortable coastal walk**

**Tip 1: Do your research**<br>
Before heading off, double-check the location, opening hours, and entrance fees (if any). Bring water and an umbrella, and always inform an adult of your whereabouts.


**Tip 2: Be present and stay alert**<br>
Keep an eye on your surroundings—take in the ground, vegetation, and water bodies around you. 

Listen for any sounds too! We often rely on our sight but the most surprising finds can come from your other senses. 

**Tip 3: Observe the details**<br>
If you pay attention, the small things will reveal themselves—from flowers and fruit in the bushes, the salty smell of the sea and seaweed, to even animals moving around in the trees or in the water. 

All of these form Singapore’s biodiversity in one way or another!

**Tip 4: Reflect and clean up**<br>
After your walk, take some time to think, discuss your observations with a friend, or take to journaling. Make sure to dispose of any trash properly before leaving. 


<b><u>Part 3: Get involved!</u></b><br>
Now that you’ve learnt a bit more, get further involved and updated with biodiversity matters! 

Here are some ways you can do so:
* Join a citizen science programme. Participate in a community research project to observe natural spaces and collect data. The information you collect will be further studied to make an impact on conservation strategies in Singapore. Find out more about [NPark’s Citizen Science Programmes](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/biodiversity/community-in-nature-initiative/citizen-science-programmes). 
* Volunteer with non-profits. Put your skills towards a good cause with non-profit organisations that might need help with graphic design, copywriting, or running events. Some organisations you can check out are [International Coastal Cleanup Singapore](coastalcleanup.nus.edu.sg/) and [Waterways Watch Society](https://www.wws.org.sg/). 
* Reduce plastic use. Plastic pollution is a big threat to biodiversity. In the oceans, plastic poses a danger to unsuspecting wildlife. If you’re able to, bring your own reusable bags and containers, and take small steps to ensure that plastic waste is recycled or disposed of responsibly. 

<b><u>Part 4: Stay updated!</u></b><br>

Containing 97 percent of Earth’s water supply, the ocean plays a huge role in regulating global temperatures, supporting plant and animal life, and contributing to the livelihoods of millions of people. But in spite of all this, the ocean remains drastically unexplored, and the details of its impact on human lives aren’t fully understood.

Every day, mysteries about the ocean are being solved, and every day, new questions come to light. The more scientists learn, the better they are able to answer these new questions.

What lies in the deep? And who is at the forefront of these exciting discoveries? The scientists and research included in this book shed light on the most pressing issues currently facing oceanographers and point us in the right direction to solving these challenges.
