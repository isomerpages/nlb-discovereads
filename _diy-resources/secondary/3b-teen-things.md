By McCall Hoyle<br>
Publisher: Blink, 2017<br>
This eBook is available on [OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com/media/3378108).¬†

Emilie Day believes in playing it safe: she‚Äôs homeschooled, her best friend is her seizure dog, and she‚Äôs probably the only girl on the Outer Banks of North Carolina who can‚Äôt swim. Then Emilie‚Äôs mom enrolls her in public school, and Emilie goes from studying at home in her pj‚Äôs to halls full of strangers. To make matters worse, Emilie is paired with starting point guard Chatham York for a major research project on Emily Dickinson. She should be ecstatic when Chatham shows interest, but she has a problem. She hasn‚Äôt told anyone about her epilepsy. Emilie lives in fear her recently adjusted meds will fail and she‚Äôll seize at school. Eventually, the worst happens, and she must decide whether to withdraw to safety or follow a dead poet‚Äôs advice and ‚Äúdwell in possibility.‚Äù¬†

#### **Think Green, Go Green!**

Engage with the world around you and pick up eco-friendly habits by repurposing the things you already have. Become part of a global initiative to combat climate change by making small lifestyle changes and adopting greener practices.

It‚Äôs often difficult to know where to begin, and you may feel like a small seed whose efforts make little difference. Don‚Äôt be discouraged! There are many things you can do, and most importantly, it is to get started.

Here are some resources to help you develop environmental mindfulness ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**Part 1: Reconnect with Nature - Forest Bathing**<br>
Known as shinrin-yoku, forest bathing does not actually involve any bathing. Instead, it is an opportunity for you to leave your tech behind, and spend some quiet time immersed in nature. Learn more about forest bathing and its benefits through this video below:

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12CCjoixpkA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Source: [The Art and Science of Forest Bathing with Dr Qing Li, Penguin Books UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12CCjoixpkA&ab_channel=PenguinBooksUK).

Here are some simple steps to forest bathe in urban Singapore, so you can take a short breather from your hectic schedules and connect with the world around you:

* Choose a park with some trees near your home. Remember to pack water and food, and inform your parents/guardian on your whereabouts before leaving home.
* Immerse yourself in your surroundings as you wander around the park for at least 15 minutes.
* Listen to the sounds around you, look at the shapes of the leaves on the trees, and feel the sensation of the ground beneath your feet.
* If you are with someone, resist talking until the end of the walk.
* Self-reflect after your walk. How did you feel? What did you experience?
