### **Tips on Mindfulness**

6 Steps to Mindfulness

Adapted from: Mindfulness on the Run: Quick, Effective Mindfulness Techniques for Busy People | Chantal Hofstee | Existe Publishing, 2016

1. Start your mornings with a hot drink and some light reading. <br>
2. When stressed, take deep breaths, drop your shoulders, and let go of any negative emotions. <br>
3. Focus on opportunities and not setbacks, because thinking positive thoughts will create more positive outcomes. <br>
4. Dedicate some time daily to reach out for a physical book without any digital distractions. <br>
5. Be fully present during conversations. Share your recent reads and discuss your favourite books. <br>
6. At the end of each day, practise gratitude by taking a moment to think about your day and what you are grateful for.
