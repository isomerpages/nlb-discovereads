### **Babies Can Be Members Too**

<img src="/images/events/baby/bcbmtnew.png" style="width:100%">

This programme aims to reach out to parents to register their babies as library members, and encourage bonding through reading at an early age. Parents can apply for the NLB membership* via the [LifeSG app](https://www.life.gov.sg/) or register [online](http://account.nlb.gov.sg/) (applicable to Singaporeans and PRs – requires Singpass login).

Parents who have registered their child as a library member are eligible to redeem a Baby Gift Pack at any participating public library (except for library@orchard, library@esplanade and library@chinatown).

This programme is for babies born from 1 Jan 2020 onwards and the Baby Gift Pack** is redeemable up until the child is 2 years old, while stocks last.

*[Membership](https://www.nlb.gov.sg/Visit/GettingOriented/Membership.aspx) fees apply for non-Singaporeans.

**The NLB reserves the right to replace the contents in the Baby Gift Pack without prior notice.
