### What is Book Bugs

Book Bugs: Rescuers of Stories Lost  is the fourth iteration of a bug-themed collectible card game reading promotion targeted at children to encourage reading in both English and Mother Tongue Languages. Borrow any library item and/or complete the monthly quizzes to earn points. Four points can be exchanged for one collectible card at participating Public Libraries.

All card redemptions at the libraries are while stocks last.
