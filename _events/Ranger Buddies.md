Ranger Buddies is a programme filled with fun missions every day that teaches children how daily small actions can benefit themselves, others, and help save the world.

From 5 Nov to 31 Dec 2021, join Khansa on a mission to fight deforestation. You can start your mission by finding Khansa amongst the bookshelves on Level 2 at Marine Parade Public Library!
