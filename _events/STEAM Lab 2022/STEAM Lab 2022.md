We have always been fascinated by the ability of the lotus leaf to stay dry even under heavy rain, or after being submerged in water. 

This is because the lotus leaf has a super water repellent ability on its surface called superhydrophobicity. As a water repellent coating, it has many potential applications. 

In this workshop, participants will be taught how to make a simple coating process to create a super-hydrophobic surface, mimicking the lotus leaf effect.
