#### Book Bugs Cut-out Workshops

In the 2021 March Holidays, we held an exciting series of workshops! Explorers got to create cut-outs of their favourite Book Bugs characters using the newest equipment available at NLBâ€™s MakeIT Makerspaces - Digital Cutting Machines! The workshops were held at Jurong Regional Library, Tampines Regional Library and Woodlands Regional Library.

Check out our Explorers and their very own Bug cut-outs!
