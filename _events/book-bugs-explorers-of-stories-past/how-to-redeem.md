### The fourth Land, Marvellous Homes, has now been released! You can also collect the bonus August card in celebration of NDP 2021.

Cards from all Lands will be available for redemption from their release date till 30 September 2021. Don't worry if you haven't collected all the cards from each Land before the launch of the next Land - you'll have plenty of time to collect all the cards!
