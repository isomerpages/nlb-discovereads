**10/11/2018: THE BOOK BUGS PLAYOFFS HAS ARRIVED!**
Registration Opens: 11am
Last Entry: 5.30pm

<u>Competitive Play Clarifications made by Gamemasters on Day 1</u>

1. In your deck of 20 cards, you can have one of each Guardian and Skorpius. This means you can have a Nostro, a Shenlong, a Skorpius s but you cannot have 2 Nostros.
2. When Nym9 or Yeticus is played on the field, it cannot be discarded, not by any of the Discard or Return to Hand effects. For “Discard the last two cards on an opponent’s field”, you also cannot jump over a Nym9/Yeticus and discard the 1st and 3rd cards.
3. But if Nym9 or Yeticus are both in your Draw pile or Hand and have not been played onto the playing field, then it can be discarded.
4. If “Look at an opponent’s hand” card effect is played, only the player who played it gets to look at the cards.
5. If “You can play an additional card on this turn” card effect is played, the additional card’s effect does not count and it only contributes towards game points.
6. Players can opt not to use their card effect.
7. If “All players to draw an additioal card” is played, this applies to the person that played the card as well.
8. If “Discard the top 2 cards from all player’s Draw piles” is played, this DOES NOT apply to the person who played the card.
9. If Nullify is played, and the second player plays another Nullify card, nothing happens because the second Nullify card is nullified. Third player continues as per usual.
10. If Nullify is played, and the second player plays Nym9 or Yeticus, they will continue have their card effect and cannot be discarded.
11. Sudden Death only applies to tied players.
12. The game ends when ONE player’s Draw pile is empty and that player has played their final card. If they end because of an card effect like “Discard any number of cards in your hand. Draw the same number of new cards from the Draw pile”, then the game ends and the player cannot play another card.
