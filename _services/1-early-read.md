## **About Early Read**

<img src="/images/Early-Readers-Logo-8cm.png" style="width: 50%;">

The Early READ Programme offers a suite of library services and resources that aims to help preschool educators and parents nurture a love for reading among young children aged 0 to 6. Through this programme, you can help your children explore reading through stories, songs and rhymes, and fun reading related activities.

Our library services and resources are centred on five literacy practices that help children develop these early literacy skills to become fluent readers:

### **Letter Knowledge**

Recognising letters and knowing their names and sounds.

### **Narrative Skills**

Being able to describe objects and events.

### **Phonological Awareness**

Understanding that words are made of smaller sounds and being able to hear and play with these smaller sounds.

### **Print Awareness**

Understanding that the print on a page represent words and knowing how to follow the words on a page and use a book.

### **Vocabulary**

Knowing the names of things, feelings and concepts.
