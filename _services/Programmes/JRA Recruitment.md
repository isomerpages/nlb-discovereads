**What is the Junior Reading Ambassador programme?**

The Junior Reading Ambassador (JRA) programme is an initiative by NLB for children aged 9 to 12 years old. The JRAs are given opportunities during their two-year term to promote reading through platforms such as storytelling, emceeing, and dramatic performances conducted in and out of the public libraries. Throughout their journey as a JRA, JRAs will meet and make new friends who share a common passion for reading.

**What is the objective of the JRA programme?**

The programme seeks to develop its participants into confident speakers and performers who can promote the love and joy of reading to their peers and the general public. It also grooms JRAs to be advocates of NLB.

**What kind of activities do JRAs do?**

JRAs conduct storytelling and dramatisation, as well as take on roles such as programme facilitators or emcees at the public libraries or external venues. Some examples of past activities include conducting immersive storytelling sessions at library@harbourfront, emceeing for kidsREAD’s anniversary celebration, and doing skit performances at the Malay Heritage Centre. JRAs are also expected to participate in online book club sessions and contribute reviews of fiction and non-fiction books from the public libraries.
