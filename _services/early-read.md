### **About**

<img src="/images/EarlyRead-Logo.jpg" alt="Early Read" style="width: 15rem;">

The Early READ Programme offers a suite of library services and resources that aims to help preschool educators and parents nurture a love for reading among young children aged 0 to 6. Through this programme, you can help your children explore reading through stories, songs and rhymes, and fun reading related activities.

Early Literacy is what children know about reading or writing before they actually learn to read and write. There are six early literacy skills that children need to become fluent readers.

Our library services and resources are centered on early literacy practices that help children develop these early literacy skills.
