From National Book Award–winning author William Alexander comes "a fun and fast-paced supernatural mystery with secret depths" (Kirkus Reviews, starred review).Rosa Ramona Díaz has a very special talent. She comes from a family of librarians who specialize in ghost appeasement. So she can't understand why her mother has moved them to Ingot, the world's only unhaunted town. What are they supposed to do there, with no poltergeists to quiet and no specters to soothe? Frankly, Rosa doesn't think anyone should want to live in a place where the biggest attraction is a woefully inaccurate Renaissance Festival. But Jasper Chevalier has always lived in Ingot, working at the festival while his parents hold court. Jasper has never seen a ghost, and can't imagine his unhaunted town any other way...until an angry apparition thunders into the fairgrounds and turns Ingot upside down. Jasper is astonished...and Rosa is delighted. Mist is building in the hills, and something otherworldly is about to be unleashed. Rosa will need all her ghost appeasement tools—and a little help from Jasper—to try to rein in the angry ghosts in this hilariously spooky adventure.
