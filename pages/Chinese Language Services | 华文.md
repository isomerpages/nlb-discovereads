#### Chinese Programmes for Secondary Schools

**Book Buzz**

We offer one Book Buzz session per school at the school premises each year. Our librarians will introduce basic library services and books that are popular among teens in a book talk consisting of 2-3 physical and e-books across various genres. Each session will be 30 to 45 minutes, done either on a small scale (classroom size) or a big scale (one level or assembly style).

**Youth Reading Series**

This programme series aims to encourage teens to rediscover the joy of reading through curated programmes such as comic- and fiction-writing workshops and explores games adapted from books.

Teachers will send and accompany the students to the selected public libraries to attend the programme. Interested teachers may email us 2 months in advance at READSingapore@nlb.gov.sg to make arrangement for the programmes.
