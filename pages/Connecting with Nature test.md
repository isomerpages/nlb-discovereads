 <h5>Why are Birds Important?</h5>
<p> Birds have a big role in the ecosystem. </p>
<ul>
  <li>They help to pollinate plants when they eat nectar from flowers. This allows plants to bear fruits.</li>
  <li>When birds eat fruits, they help to spread seeds through their droppings.</li>
  <li>They also help to manage pests as some birds eat insects.</li>
</ul>
