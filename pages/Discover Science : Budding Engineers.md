<p>Have you ever wondered if you could move something without touching it? We’ll learn how we can power a rocket to cruise through the galaxy and even drive a car ​​— by using magnets and their powerful magnetic forces!  <br><br>
Sounds impossible? As this famous quote by Norman Vincent Peale goes: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.” If we never try, we never know! <br><br>
The meaning behind the quote is to pursue ambitious goals even success remains undetermined. Even if things don’t turn out as expected, you’ll still accomplish great things.</p>

<h4>LET'S LEARN!</h4>

 <p>Welcome to the magical world of magnets! Your child will discover, learn and enjoy a lot of things as they observe magnetic forces in action while doing these STEAM activities.</p>
 
 <p>A magnet is a piece of metal or rock that</p>
<ul>
  <li>attracts and repels other magnets; and </li>
  <li>	can pull certain types of metals toward itself.</li>
</ul>
