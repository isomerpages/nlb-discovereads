<p>Have you ever wondered if you could move something without touching it? We’ll learn how we can power a rocket to cruise through the galaxy and even drive a car ​​— by using magnets and their powerful magnetic forces!  <br><br>
Sounds impossible? As this famous quote by Norman Vincent Peale goes: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars.” If we never try, we never know! <br><br>
The meaning behind the quote is to pursue ambitious goals even success remains undetermined. Even if things don’t turn out as expected, you’ll still accomplish great things.</p>

<h4>LET'S LEARN!</h4>
<img src="/images/science-lfa/magnetic-rockets/magnet2.png" style="width:400px; text-align:left;">

 <p>Welcome to the magical world of magnets! Your child will discover, learn and enjoy a lot of things as they observe magnetic forces in action while doing these STEAM activities.</p>
 
 <p>A magnet is a piece of metal or rock that</p>
<ul>
  <li>attracts and repels other magnets; and </li>
  <li>	can pull certain types of metals toward itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Explain to your child that the pulling and pushing forces are called magnetism. These forces occur every day even though we cannot see them.<br><br>

 <h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Children are very curious. One of the best things you can do is to explore with your child and have them try making guesses as to why certain things happen.</li>
  <li>	As they conduct their experiments, encourage your child to ask questions and praise them when they learn something new! </li>
</ul>

     <p>Let's familiarise your child with new STEAM words relating to magnets.<br>
The words have been arranged so that they can be found horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. <br>
Teach your children about strategy. One way is to go through the puzzle from left to right and look for the first letter of each word, and then check the surrounding letters for the next word. <br>
This activity will help your child to understand the idea of direction: 
horizontal (across), vertical (up and down) and diagonal (at an angle).

<p>These are some new vocabulary words relating to magnets, but some vowels are missing. Have your child guess the missing letters.</p>
<ul>	<li>_ T T R _ C T</li>
	<li>R _ P _ L</li>
	<li>M _ G N _ T</li>
	<li>F _ R C _ S</li>
	<li>N _ R T H   P _ L _</li>
	<li>S _ _ T H   P _ L _</li></ul>
	
<p>Draw your child’s attention to these points as they observe magnets at work: </p>
<ul>	<li>There are invisible pull and push forces that can move certain objects through attraction and repulsion. </li>
<li>All magnets have two poles, North and South. The opposite poles will pull together and stick, while the same poles will push away from one another.</li></ul>

<p>There are so many more things you can do with magnets! Experimentation and play are fantastic ways for your child to learn a difficult concept. Read some of our book recommendations to further supplement your child’s understanding.</p>

<h4>Checklist for Experiments and Crafts</h4>
