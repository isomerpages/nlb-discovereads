<p><b>Suitable for 4 to 6 years old children</b></p>

<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/Thumbnail.png" style="width:200px; text-align:center;">

<p>Squares, triangles, and rectangles are shapes that can be found in the world around us. There are also many other interesting shapes such as pentagons, hexagons, and octagons. Let us enter the wonderful world of polygons and discover the shapes that are around us!</p>

<p> Let us have some fun learning about the concept of shapes and polygons with books and art materials!</p>

<h4>LET'S SING!</h4>
<h5>Tuning-in Song: We are Shapes</h5>   

<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/TuningInSong.jpg" style="width:600px; text-align:center;">

<p> Repeat this song with other shapes such as circles, rectangles and triangles and ask your child if they can notice and name any differences between their characteristics!</p>

<p>The full song lyrics can be found here:<a href="https://go.gov.sg/weareshapessonglyrics" target="_blank"> Full Song Lyrics for We Are Shapes</a></p>

<b><p>Tips for Parents:</p></b>
<p>The repetitive nature of the song helps with pattern recognition and rhythm synchronisation. The catchy rhythm helps your child remember what they are learning, and they will be singing about the different properties of shapes in no time!</p>

<p><b>What Can I Be?</b><br>
        <u>By:</u> Ann Rand & Ingrid Fiksdahl King<br>
        <u>Publisher:</u> New York : Princeton Architectural Press, [2016]<br>

<b><p>Tips for Parents:</p></b>
<p>Asking open-ended questions is an important way to guide a child’s exploration. It can also introduce new vocabulary to them when you ask questions that require them to make simple comparisons between objects that they observe in their immediate environment.</p>

<b><p>Questions to spark discussion with your child:</p></b>
<p>1. Which is your favourite shape? Why do you like that shape?</p>
 <p>2. How are these shapes similar and different? Can you list down the characteristics for me?</p>
 <p>3. What other objects do you think these shapes could be?</p>
 
 <h4>LET'S LEARN!</h4>
<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/Polygons.png" style="width:200px; text-align:center;">

<b><p>What are Polygons?</p></b>

<p> A polygon is a flat, two-dimensional (2D) shape with straight sides that are fully closed (all the sides are joined up).</p>
 <p> The sides must be straight.</p>
 <p> Polygons may have any number of sides.</p>

<p><u> Definition of a Polygon</u><br><i> The School Run. (2022). What is a polygon? TheSchoolRun. Retrieved April 30, 2022, from <a href=" https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-polygon " target="_blank"> https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-polygon</a></i>
	
<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/What%20are%20Polygons.png" style="width:400px; text-align:center;">

<p> Discuss with your child if they can tell you which of the following three shapes above our polygons and their reasons why they chose that shape. Ask them if they can relate their decision to the characteristics they had learnt above. </p>

<p> Polygons are named by the number of their shapes, and you can find them all around you!</p>

<p>Download the flash cards at: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/polygonworksheet1" target="_blank"> Polygon Worksheet Part 1</a> and <a href="https://go.gov.sg/polygonworksheet2" target="_blank"> Polygon Worksheet Part 2</a> to go through the names and properties of some well-known polygons with your child, as well as common objects that have the same shapes.</p>

<p>It may be a mouthful, but squares and rectangles are also known as Quadrilaterals, a name that refers to their four sides! Here are some flashcards to help them retain this fun fact: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/funfactsquadrilaterals" target="_blank"> Fun Facts of Quadrilaterals</a></p>

<b><p>Tips for Parents:</p></b>
<p>Ask your child to observe their surroundings around them. Have them point out to you shapes and polygons that they can see around them. Make it into a fun game! It can be a variation of "I Spy." For example, "I spy...a circle!" Whoever is guessing needs to find as many circle-shaped objects they can find.</p>

<b><p>What are 3D Shapes?</p></b>

<p> Once your child understands 2D shapes, i.e. flat shapes, you can slowly start introducing them to 3D shapes!</p>

<p>To differentiate between 2D and 3D Shapes, let us look at a triangle and pyramid side by side!</p>

<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/2dvs3d.png" style="width:400px; text-align:center;">

<img src="
/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/2dvs3ddifference.png" style="width:400px; text-align:center;">

<p> The most important differences between a 2D shape and a 3D shape are the below:</p>

<p> -  A 2D shape is flat while a 3D shape can be physically held.</p>
 <p> - A 2D shape has only one face while a 3D shape has multiple faces.</p>
 
<p>Can your child identify and name 3D shapes?

<p>Teach them on the different characteristics of cubes, cuboids, pyramids, and cones with this simple set of flashcards: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/differencesbetween3dshapes" target="_blank"> Differences Between 3D Shapes</a></p>

<b><p>Tips for Parents:</p></b>
<p>Linking theory to the physical environment is the best way for children to learn about scientific concepts as they can then better understand the relevance of these concepts in their lives. If you notice any 2D and 3D shapes around, point them out to your child or ask them if they recognise these shapes and if they remember how their properties differ. For example, you could play ball with your children and pause for a while to ask them if they recognise the shape of the ball.</p>

<h5>LET’S CRAFT!</h5>   

<b><p>Let Us Make Some Collage Robots!</p></b>

<p> Time to have some fun! Let us get creative and make robots out of polygons. Here is what you will need:</p>

<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/Materials%20Needed.png" style="width:600px; text-align:center;">

<p><b>Instructions</b></p>

<p>1.  Select one sheet of colouring paper to be the base. This is where you will stick the parts to make your robot.<br></p>
    
<p>2.  Draw out the shapes you want to use to make your robot! To challenge yourself, try to have at least 1 of each polygon. I.e., 1 triangle, 1 square, 1 rectangle, 1 pentagon, 1 hexagon and 1 octagon. Do ensure your shapes are small enough to fit onto your base!
<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/Shapes.jpeg" style="width:400px; text-align:left;"><br></p>
 
<p>3.  Time to cut them out! Get Mommy or Daddy to help you with this part. <br></p>
<p>4.  Feel free to cut out more in any colour and size for extra parts and decorations!<br></p>

<p>5.  Paste your shapes onto your base paper to form a robot, in any way that you like! Use markers to scribble on any additional touches.<br></p>
<p>6.   Ta-da! You have your very own robot collage! Check out mine below! <img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/Complete%20Robot%20Collage.jpeg" style="width:400px; text-align:left;"><br></p>

<p> His name is Turturo, and he is a turtle-bird robot! He has parts that help him fly and swim, and his hobbies include trimming tree branches and diving for pearls to adorn his body.</p>

<p> Can you count and identify the different shapes and colours I used to make him?</p>

<b><p>Tips for Parents:</p></b>
<p>Encourage your child to share with you their creations! Engaging them to communicate their creative processes through language is a great way to build up their speaking, thinking and cognitive skills.</p>

<h4>LET'S PLAY!</h4>

<p> After making these lovely creations, ask your child the questions below to keep interesting conversations going about geometrical concepts!</p>

<p>1. What shapes do you notice as you make your origami creation?</p>
 <p>2. How many sides does your origami creation have?</p>
 <p>3. Can your origami stand upright or lie flat? What does that tell you? </p>

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<p> Explore music and movement with your child based on the human body parts.  Point to your own body parts, come up with your own tune, sing, move, and dance. Do not be afraid of being silly or singing off-key. Your child will remember things better when they are said in 
rhyme or sung to a catchy tune.</p>

<h4>LET'S LEARN!</h4>

<p> Did you know these fun facts about the human body?<p>  
<ul>
<li> Your teeth are as strong as a shark’s teeth – but your jaws are smaller, so you can’t bite like a shark.</li>
<li> Some parts of your body can never be replaced. The enamel on your teeth and the goo inside your eyes will last all your life. </li>
<li> By the time you were six months old, your eyes were already two-thirds their adult size.</li>
<li> Fingerprints are not the body’s only unique pattern. You can also be identified by your tongue print, your personal smell, and the pattern in your iris (the coloured part of your eye)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<p> You may also ask your child the following questions as they play with their Human Body Puppet.</p>
<p>1. Can you name the different body parts?</p>
<p>2. What are the organs in our body?</p>
<p>3. What are the functions of each body part?</p>
<p>4. What will happen if one of our body parts is missing? For example, what happens if we don’t have our eyes?</p>

<p> Asking open-ended questions will give your child opportunities to think about their answers and express their thoughts. Their answers may not be entirely right so this is where you can encourage and guide them!</p>
<h4>LET'S TRY THESE AT HOME</h4>

<p>1. Have your child stand in front of the mirror and point to each of their body parts, e.g. their head, 
their hips, their belly etc.  Say the names of these parts aloud and get them to repeat after you.</p>

<p>Repeat this exercise every day and start by first teaching them the upper body parts (parts of the face 
and shoulders) before moving on to the middle body parts (stomach, arms etc.) and gradually to lower
