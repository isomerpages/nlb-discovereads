<p><b>Suitable for 4 to 6 years old children</b></p>

<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/Thumbnail.png" style="width:400px; text-align:center;">

<p>Squares, triangles, and rectangles are shapes that can be found in the world around us. There are also many other interesting shapes such as pentagons, hexagons, and octagons. Let us enter the wonderful world of polygons and discover the shapes that are around us!</p>

<p> Let us have some fun learning about the concept of shapes and polygons with books and art materials!</p>

<h4>LET'S SING!</h4>
<h5>Tuning-in Song: We are Shapes</h5>   

<img src="/images/science-lfa/Shapes%20and%20Polygons/TuningInSong.jpg" style="width:600px; text-align:center;">

<p> Repeat this song with other shapes such as circles, rectangles and triangles and ask your child if they can notice and name any differences between their characteristics!</p>

The full song lyrics can be found here: [https://go.gov.sg/weareshapessonglyrics](https://go.gov.sg/weareshapessonglyrics)

<b><p>Tips for Parents:</p></b>
<p> The repetitive nature of the song helps with pattern recognition and rhythm synchronisation. The catchy rhythm helps your child remember what they are learning, and they will be singing about the different properties of shapes in no time!</p>

<p> The human body is a complex machine. The different parts of our body work together to do many amazing things. Let’s have some fun learning about the human body and how it functions!</p>

     <p><b> My Body Song | CoComelon Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs (4 min 37 secs) </b><br>A tuning-in song is a simple way to introduce your child to their body parts. Singing and dancing help your child grasp and retain what they have learnt.

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<p> Explore music and movement with your child based on the human body parts.  Point to your own body parts, come up with your own tune, sing, move, and dance. Do not be afraid of being silly or singing off-key. Your child will remember things better when they are said in 
rhyme or sung to a catchy tune.</p>

<h4>LET'S LEARN!</h4>
<img src="/images/science-lfa/Human%20body/body2.png" style="width:350px; text-align:center;">

<p> Did you know these fun facts about the human body?<p>  
<ul>
<li> Your teeth are as strong as a shark’s teeth – but your jaws are smaller, so you can’t bite like a shark.</li>
<li> Some parts of your body can never be replaced. The enamel on your teeth and the goo inside your eyes will last all your life. </li>
<li> By the time you were six months old, your eyes were already two-thirds their adult size.</li>
<li> Fingerprints are not the body’s only unique pattern. You can also be identified by your tongue print, your personal smell, and the pattern in your iris (the coloured part of your eye)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<p> Doing simple activities such as these with your child will help spark an interest on the topic, even for concepts that may seem to be way over their heads. Don’t underestimate how much your child can absorb new information! Once, your child is interested in learning more, you can supplement their knowledge with books from the library!</p>

<h4>Tips for Parents:</h4> 
<p> You may also ask your child the following questions as they play with their Human Body Puppet.</p>
<p>1. Can you name the different body parts?</p>
<p>2. What are the organs in our body?</p>
<p>3. What are the functions of each body part?</p>
<p>4. What will happen if one of our body parts is missing? For example, what happens if we don’t have our eyes?</p>

<p> Asking open-ended questions will give your child opportunities to think about their answers and express their thoughts. Their answers may not be entirely right so this is where you can encourage and guide them!</p>
<h4>LET'S TRY THESE AT HOME</h4>

<p>1. Have your child stand in front of the mirror and point to each of their body parts, e.g. their head, 
their hips, their belly etc.  Say the names of these parts aloud and get them to repeat after you.</p>

<p>Repeat this exercise every day and start by first teaching them the upper body parts (parts of the face 
and shoulders) before moving on to the middle body parts (stomach, arms etc.) and gradually to lower 
body parts (legs, feet and backside).</p>

<p>Slowly, your child will begin to recognise their body parts!</p>
<img src="/images/science-lfa/Human%20body/body16.png" style="width:450px; text-align:center;">
	
<p>2. Play a movement game with your child to help them develop their body awareness. Get them to 
walk in different directions. For example,forwards and backwards, running, jump, balance on one foot 
like a flamingo and so on.</p>
