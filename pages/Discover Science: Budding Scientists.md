## ABC's of Applied Physics for Kids: It's Time to Learn about Time!
****Suitable for 4 to 6 years old****

(can't find this image)

Time is an interesting phenomenon. It is untouchable, invisible and yet it is always around us. Let’s have some fun learning about the concept of time and routine with the use of clocks!

#### LET'S SING!
#### Tuning-in Song: Hickory Dickory Dock
A tuning-in song is a simple, yet important component to include when introducing children to new concepts, especially abstract ones. It acts like a fun hook and energises them for the actual learning activity later.

#### Tips for Parents:
The repetitive nature of the song helps with pattern recognition and rhythm synchronisation. Children can understand and expect the changes in the structure of the song, which develops their mathematical awareness. Encourage your child to clap along with the striking of the clock. E.g. clap once when the clock strikes One, twice when the clock strikes Two etc.

### LET'S READ!

### LET'S CRAFT!
#### Crafting your own Clock!

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/ClockCraft.jpg)

Children can try making their own clock so that they can get familiar with the different parts of the clock and their functions. In time, they can learn about the values of seconds, minutes, and hours as well as other instruments that tell time.

This crafting activity is simple and requires materials that can be found around the house. Download and print the template below to help you!

[Template for Clock Crafting Activity](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/TemplateforClockCraftingActivity.PDF)

### Instructions
1. Cut out a circle from felt board or drawing block, roughly 15cm in diameter for the clock face.

2. Cut out the circles and clock hands from the template prepared.

3. Write down the numbers "1" to "12" on each of the circles. Have your child count along as you do this.

4. Using a paper fastener, fasten all three of the clock hands to the face and ta-da! You have your very own wonderful time teller!

### LET'S INVESTIGATE!
#### Learning with your Handmade Clock
We just made a very wonderful Time Teller! Time for us to use it to teach our children a few key concepts about time.

### LET'S PLAY!
Play is a great way to get children excited about learning and discovering new concepts.

Download and print out the resources below for activities that you can do with your child to help them learn the wonders of routines.

The first activity will teach your child the different times of the day; i.e. morning, afternoon, evening and night as well as the activities we should be doing during these times. Print these out and play a fun matching game with them!

[Different Times of the Day!](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/DifferentTimesofDayActivity.pdf)

The second activity will expose your child to the wonderful world of time tellers. Aside from our humble clock, there are so many other key instruments that measure and record time. Can your child name all of the ones in this printable activity?

[Different Time Tellers!](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/DifferentTimeTellersActivity.pdf)

Do you know that Sundials were one of the first time-telling devices invented? See if your child can guess what the sundial uses to tell time!

![sundial](/images/Sundial.png)

### LET'S TRY THESE AT HOME!
With a little bit of creativity and using objects around you, you can create simple yet fun activities for your child to supplement their reading.

How about giving the two activities below a try? They will give your child a little peek into history on how people told time before clocks as well as understand the difference between Analog and Digital clocks.

### Activity 1: How Did People Tell Time Before Clocks?

1. At around 9-10am, ask your child if they can see the sun from the window. Ask them to describe the sun; e.g. does it look further away or closer or does it feel hotter?

2. Have them write down or draw their observations. They can fill up the table appended below.

[My Observation Table](/files/science-lfa/applied-physics-time/MyObservationTable.pdf)

3. Repeat this activity at 12-1pm and again, at 5-6pm. Ask them if they notice any difference in the sun's position in their observations.

4. Explain to your child that before clocks were invented, this was one of the earliest ways people told time; by looking at the position of the sun in relation to where they lived.

5. Have your child think more deeply by asking them how people told time during rainy or cloudy weather.

Note: Do remind your child to take breaks as prolonged staring at the sun may damage their eyes.

### Activity 2: Analog vs Digital

![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/AnalogvsDigital.png)

In this modern world, clocks come in all different shapes, sizes, and forms. Analog clocks may still be around, but we start seeing digital clocks crop up more and more. This simple game will help your child be more exposed to the different timepieces.

1. On a deck of flash cards or strips of leftover paper, write down the time as your child would see on an analog clock; e.g. 5pm.

2. On another set of cards or strips, write down the same timing in digital format; e.g. 1700.

3. Explain to your child that these are the same timings but in different formats.

4. Once they become more confident, start writing down timings in analog format and have them rewrite the timings in digital formats. Take turns being Analog and being Digital.

#### Tips for Parents:
Observing their environment and identifying differences is an easy way to get children thinking in a more scientific manner. Guide them along with probing questions: why do they think that way and how did they come to that conclusion? As time is abstract, do not feel discouraged if your child takes a while to understand. With consistent encouragement, they will eventually get the hang of it.

#### LET'S WATCH!
Unwind with your child with these helpful videos in understanding horology, the study of time, a little better. Horology itself is a word that you can teach your children!

ABC's of Applied Chemistry for Kids:
Let’s Learn About Density
Suitable for 4 to 6 years old

Whether it is bath time or dishwashing time, your child would be exposed to liquid soap and soap foam. Why not take these moments as opportunities to spark their curiosity about the densities of everyday objects? Read on to introduce your child to the concept of density, allow them to experiment with household liquid materials, and create ‘fireworks’ in a bottle together!

LET’S LEARN

Density is a measurement that compares the amount of matter an object as to its volume.
(Density Facts for Kids. (2021). Density Facts for Kids. Retrieved December 28, 2021, from https://kids.kiddle.co/Density)

Use these printables to further explain density to your child!

Try introducing these words to your child! Here are some example sentences to incorporate:
Liquid	Liquids do not have a definite shape, so they take up the shape of the container they are poured into. Water and oil are liquids.
Solid	Solids have a definite shape, so they do not change shapes. For instance, this bowl that we are holding is a solid.
Float	Let’s put this pencil into water. Do you see that it floats on water?
Sink	Try putting this coin into water. It sinks all the way to the bottom!
Molecules	Molecules are very small substances that make up an object. You cannot see molecules with your eyes! You would need a microscope.
Density	The density of an object depends on how many molecules make up the object.
Tips for Parents:
Constant repetition and exposure are key in not just improving vocabulary but also in giving children the confidence to pick up unfamiliar words.

All About Animals:
Let’s Learn about Marine Animals
Suitable for 4 to 6 years old


The ocean is home to thousands of different marine animals, such as clownfishes, sharks, whales, dolphins and many more.

In addition, they come in all shapes and sizes, and have developed special features that enable them to survive underwater. Ever wondered what is the living habitat like for these marine animals? Let’s read on to find out more!

LET'S SING!
Tuning-in Song: One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Once I Caught a Fish Alive
A tuning-in song is a simple activity that introduces children to new concepts. In this tuning-in song, children can recognise the patterns in rhymes and associate the words with the corresponding actions. You can also let your child choose their favourite marine animals to incorporate into the song. This encourages them to be creative as they sing along to the tune.


LET'S LEARN!

Did you know that the water covers approximately 71% of the Earth's surface? Out of which, 98% of the water on Earth belongs to the ocean! You can find the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Southern Ocean on the world map. They are all connected as one ocean and water flows freely between them.

LET'S PLAY!
We have included a world map activity sheet. Have your child write the names of the oceans as you share the fun facts below. Through this activity, your child can see how the 5 oceans are connected.


Below is the answer sheet for the world map activity sheet.

Fun Facts
The water in the ocean contains large amounts of salt. You may wonder, how is the ocean so salty? This is because there is salt in the rocks found on land. When rain falls, the rainwater erodes the rocks, and the salt particles are transported to rivers and streams before reaching the ocean. This process makes the ocean salty.



Mocomi Kids. (2019). Why Is The Sea Salty - Curious Questions with Answers | Educational Videos by Mocomi Kids. YouTube. Retrieved December 30, 2021, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qbUUGguJjE )

LET'S THINK!

Do you think we can drink seawater (i.e. the water from the ocean)? Why?
If you drink seawater, these salt particles will get absorbed into our blood and flow through our body. Our body cannot get rid of the salt particles and this can cause our body to feel dehydrated, or extremely thirsty.

LET'S LEARN!

The ocean is home to many marine animals (such as whales, sharks, jellyfishes, starfishes, octopuses, etc). Although there is a high concentration of salt in the ocean, these animals have developed ways to cope and remove excess salt from their bodies so they can survive in the ocean.
