## **Play**

### **Introduction**

Play enables children to develop their language, social-emotional and cognitive skills. It also encourages imagination and creativity. Learning through play comes in many forms such as imaginary play, cooperative play and physical play. They are further categorised into instructional play, games, guided and free play, depending on the degree in which children are given control over their experiences during play.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Hide-and-Seek** <br>
Have fun with your child by playing the good, old game of hide-and-seek. You can have different themes such as finding the hidden animals, specific objects, photos of family members, or simply seeking each other from hidden areas within the house. 

You can make the game more challenging for older children by asking them to find sight words, providing a treasure map, or giving verbal clues to describe the location. 

**Can You Do This With Me?** <br>
Engage your child in learning by encouraging them to mimic your actions! Point and identify different parts of the body, emphasise the pronunciation of the letters and simple words, or even explore emotions using facial expressions. 

You can challenge your older child to pronounce words with more syllables, trying out different action words or even counting with fingers. Take turns with your child and be prepared to be challenged as well. 

**Sensory Play** <br>
Sensory play stimulates your child’s senses and develops their sensory processing capabilities. It also encourages your child to create, investigate and discover! 

Regular household items can be used for sensory play too. Here are some examples:
* Explore textures of tissue paper, kitchen paper, and writing paper
* Sort toys by colours
* Locate household items of different shapes 
* Discover smells and tastes of different fruits/ food items
* Compare sounds by tapping a spoon on different objects

Older children can also engage in sensory play such as playing with play dough, creating musical instruments with recycled materials, or even baking!
