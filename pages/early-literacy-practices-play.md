## **Play**

### **Introduction**

Play enables children to develop their language, social-emotional and cognitive skills. It also encourages imagination and creativity. Learning through play comes in many forms such as imaginary play, cooperative play and physical play. They are further categorised into instructional play, games, guided and free play, depending on the degree in which children are given control over their experiences during play.

### **Recommended Activities**

**The Human Body** <br>
This simple activity helps your child learn about body parts through play. Prepare pictures of various body parts. Randomly show a picture of a body part and get your child to point to the same part on their body. You can make the activity challenging by getting your child to name or spell the body part. 

During this activity, you could share one or two facts about the body part.

**Colourful Fruits and Vegetables** <br>
A trip to the supermarket can be a fun family activity. Prepare a set of missions for your child to identify different fruits and vegetables by colours. For example, “Find and name three green fruits”. 

Make this activity more challenging by mixing up colours and produce. For example, “Find and name one purple vegetable and one red fruit.” 

**Let’s Travel to Space!** <br>
Free play or unstructured play helps exercise your child’s creativity and problem-solving skills. Create a spaceship with an old cardboard box or any box that your child can sit in. Get your child to talk to you about what they will need while travelling in space for a week. For any items that cannot be found at home, draw or make them from recyclable materials with your child.
