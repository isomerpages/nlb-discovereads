## **Read**

### **Introduction**

Reading with children develops their language and literacy skills. Words can be found all around us, for example, on cereal boxes and advertisements. Recognizing such **environmental print** allows children to differentiate text from pictures at an early age by reading the words in their immediate surroundings.

Reading books to children teaches them how to handle books as well as how text flows from left to right and from top to bottom of a page. In addition, books expose children to words they may not learn through daily conversation. Parents should also talk to children about what they have read together to help them understand the story.
 
### **Recommended Activities**

**Alphabet Smash** <br>
Are you ready for a smashing good time with your child? All you need for this activity is a piece of paper, writing materials or any alphabet toys and modelling clay. Write the alphabet or lay out alphabet toys on the piece of paper. Mould the modelling clay into balls. Say out a letter and guide your young child to smash the letter on the paper with the clay ball. Not only will they learn the letters, but they will also develop their sensory skills as they touch and feel the modelling clay. 

For older children, you can prepare simple words or images for them to smash. If images are used, it can even be a sorting game where they use a different modelling clay colour to smash the odd images.

**Cookbooking** <br>
Cooking is always a delightful activity for children, especially when they are given a free pass to make a small mess and of course, when they can eat the results!

Get easy-to-read recipes available from the internet or from cookbooks. Select a recipe that is easy to follow and does not require too many ingredients or complicated steps. Show your child the recipe and go over it together. Ask your child to read the recipe to you as you work. Explain that each step must be done in the stated order. For younger children who are not able to read independently, you can read the recipe for them instead. Engage your child in the preparation by letting them do the simple steps such as help mixing the ingredients, using the cookie cutter or adding sprinkles.

For older children, allow your child to write down other recipes from the cookbook that they would like to make together.

**Let's Go Shopping!** <br>
This is the easiest literacy activity ever! Write out the alphabet on a piece of paper. Sit down with a familiar book. Instead of reading the book, you will just be using it to find letters. Look for each letter and turn the page from time to time for a new search area. You can adjust the difficulty level for this activity by looking only for 5-10 letters instead of the whole alphabet. For older children, look for sight words instead of letters.
