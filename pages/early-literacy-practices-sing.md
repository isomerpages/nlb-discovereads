## **Sing**

### **Introduction**

Singing helps your child learn how to hear smaller sounds in words.  Learning to hear and break down parts of words help your child develop phonological awareness, which will help him learn to read.

Do not be afraid of being silly or singing off-key; your child will not mind at all.  He is more likely to love the great bonding experience of singing with you!  Children also remember things better when they are said in a rhyme or sung to a catchy tune.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Nursery Rhymes and Songs Cube** <br>
Make your own nursery rhymes and songs cube!  It is a great way to encourage your child to sing nursery rhymes and songs. Let your child roll the cube and identify the rhyme or song to sing together.

Use an empty square tissue box and fill it with recycled paper. It will be better if the box is filled so that it is sturdier. Find some recycled wrapping paper or brown craft paper to cover up all sides of the box with tape.  Decide on six nursery rhymes that your child is familiar with and find clip art images that represent each of the rhymes as well as a short word that goes along with it. 

For example, “Itsy Bitsy Spider” is represented by a clipart of a spider and the word “Spider”;  “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” is represented by a clipart of a star and the word “Star”. Your completed nursery rhymes and songs cube should look something like the image below. Do ensure that all six sides of the cube are represented by a rhyme or song.

Change the nursery rhymes or make a new cube with 6 different nursery rhymes or songs to add some variety.

**I Spy... Rhyme** <br>
Play the classic game of I Spy. First, explain to your child that there are rhyming things all around us. Second, provide your child with a clue word and guide them to find an item in the room that rhymes with the clue word. The clue should be a one-syllable word such as ball, cat, mouse, duck etc. To play the game, you can follow the example given below and adapt accordingly.

Parent: I spy, with my little eye. Something that rhymes with hook.<br>
Child: \[looking around\] … I don’t know. <br>
Parent: Hmm, what is on the shelf over there? <br>
Child: A book? <br>
Parent: Yes, a book. Does that rhyme with hook? Say the two words together. <br>
Child: Hook and book. <br>
Parent: Do they rhyme? <br>
Child: Yes! <br>
Parent: Yes, hook rhymes with book. <br>

If the child is not able to find something that rhymes, you may provide more clues and narrow the search area to help them.

**Matching Rhyme Time!** <br>
This is a fun and easy rhyming card game for the whole family! Prepare a set of picture cards. Each picture card will have its matching card that rhymes with it. For example, a card with an image of a cat and another card with an image of a hat as seen below. Other examples can include, “fox” and “box”, “dog” and “log”, “slug” and “jug” etc.

To play the game, separate the pairs of rhyming cards into two separate stacks and face both stacks down on a flat surface. Take turns with your child to flip over one picture card from each stack and name the picture seen on the card.

If a rhyming match is made, you or your child call out “Rhyme Time!” and keep the pair of rhyming picture cards. If a match is not made, return the card randomly to the respective stacks. Continue until all the matches are made.

Depending on your child’s age, you can tweak the level of difficulty accordingly. Challenge your child to try naming another item or object that also rhymes with the matching cards.
