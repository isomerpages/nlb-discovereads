## **Sing**

### **Introduction**

Singing helps your child learn how to hear smaller sounds in words.  Learning to hear and break down parts of words help your child develop phonological awareness, which will help him learn to read.

Do not be afraid of being silly or singing off-key; your child will not mind at all.  He is more likely to love the great bonding experience of singing with you!  Children also remember things better when they are said in a rhyme or sung to a catchy tune.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Matching Letter Sounds with Pictures** <br>
Prepare pictures of various objects, animals and even places. Pronounce clearly and go through the names of each picture. Say and emphasize a letter sound and ask your child to identify the pictures that start with the letter sound. For example, the letter “A” is linked with pictures of “Apple”, “Ant”, and “Airport”. 

To extend the activity, you can engage your child in using LEGO blocks or play dough to form the letters or words of the pictures. 

**Alphabet Hide-and-Seek** <br>
Write all the letters in the alphabet on individual Post-it notes and paste them around the house. Draw twenty-six boxes on a big piece of paper. Invite your child to find the missing letters and place them back on the big piece of paper in order. Sing the Alphabet Song as your child plays the game. For younger children, you may write the alphabet in the boxes, to help your child match the letter on the Post-it notes to the letter on the big piece of paper.

To extend the activity, you can discuss with your child and find items in the house that match with the letter sounds. For example, an aeroplane toy to represent letter “A”.

**Name the Song** <br>
Take turns with family members to dramatize the story of different nursery songs. The last hint can be humming or tapping the rhythm to the tune of the song. The aim of this game is to guess the name of the song correctly. This is a great family activity to bond with and have fun together!

To extend the activity, identify certain words in the nursery songs and think of similar rhyming words.
