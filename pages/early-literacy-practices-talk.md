## **Talk**

### **Introduction**

Talking helps a child develop early literacy skills. Nurture your babbling baby into a talkative toddler by talking and reading to him often. Talking is also an excellent way to build his narrative skills. These skills are needed to help him with reading as he grows older.

Read aloud and encourage your child to read along with you. You can initiate conversations about stories by asking, “What do you see on this page?” or “What do you think will happen next?”

## **Recommended Activities**

**Dollars and Sense** <br>
Talking about the value of money is a great way to instil good  financial habits in young children. Take the opportunity to introduce your child to important money concepts during your daily activities. For example, "I am going to pay $5 for the milk and bread." Or "I have some extra coins here and I am going to save them in my piggy bank." 

Introduce younger children to the different coin denominations through a coin colouring activity. Place different coins under a piece of white paper and get your child to colour over them. Name and describe the coins as your child creates colourful coin impressions. Make the activity more challenging for older children by getting them to match a new set of coins to the correct impressions.

Create pretend money and engage in a role play with your child to introduce them to the basics of buying and selling. Set up an imaginary store with their toys and label them with a price tag. Take turns to be the customer and shop owner and use related words such as "price", "expensive", "cheap", "more," "less", "pay", "buy" or “sell".

**I Can Go Green!** <br>
How can you go green? Help your child to understand that they have a part to play in protecting the environment by talking to them about conservation and the impact we have on the environment.  Describe the different ways to go green during their daily lives. For example, “Turn off the tap when you are brushing your teeth.” or “Let’s bring a reusable bag for grocery shopping so that we can reduce the use of plastic.”

As your child grows older, you can get them involved in sorting the trash at home into the different types of recyclables. Get them to create and decorate their own small recycling bins to keep them committed to the recycling activity. Make recycling more fun by going on a scavenger hunt in the park or beach and see how  many recyclables you can collect.

**Safety and Me** <br>
Talk about personal safety early, regularly and clearly with your child. Use the appropriate language about safe and unsafe behaviours, people and situations. For example, “The pot is hot and you will get hurt if you touch it. Move over here.” or “The floor is wet. I do not want you to slip so please hold my hand.” Introduce the different safety precautions through discussions and fun activities. 

Get started by filling a bag with safety props such as toy road signs, a toy phone and a plaster. Include pictures of safety workers such as a firefighter, a policeman and a paramedic. Take out one object or picture at a time and get your child to talk about it. You may ask, “How does this tool protect us?” Or “What does this safety worker do to help us?”. You can expand the activity by asking your child to match the safety workers to the tools they use.

For older children, create a giant map of a neighbourhood on a big piece of paper together. Include roads, pavements, crossings, safety signs, traffic lights and buildings you typically see in a neighbourhood such as a police station and a school. Get your child to place their toy vehicles and people at the correct place and explain their decisions. Spend some time talking about road safety, the different dangerous situations that can happen in a neighbourhood and the safety measures they can take.
