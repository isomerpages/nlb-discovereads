## **Write**

### **Introduction**

Writing helps children develop motor skills and understand that written words represent ideas. It allows children to express themselves through language. Through writing, they also learn the conventions of written language and how to read. At the pre-writing stage, they do not need to write legibly – being able to scribble or trace is a good start.

### **Recommended Activities**

**Connect the Dots** <br>
If your child is just starting to learn how to write, it would be useful for them to learn basic writing patterns such as zigzags, curves and diagonals. What is great about this activity is that writing pattern worksheets are easily available online for you to print and share with your child. Make the activity fun by experimenting with different types of writing surfaces and materials.

**Rhymes** <br>
Rhymes are great for building vocabulary. For this activity, you will need to gather some words that rhyme. Print out images that represent these words and group them together based on how they rhyme. Explain to your child the different groups. For example, “These words are grouped together because they end with -ime.” Ask your child to guess the word that corresponds with the image. For older children, you may get them to write down the word on a piece of paper. 

This activity can be expanded to introduce words that begin with the same letters. For example, words that begin with the letters “ch-”, such as chair, child, chime, chore, etc.

**Finger Painting** <br>
This simple activity helps children get used to writing as it closely replicates writing with a pencil. All you need are pieces of paper and child-friendly non-toxic paints in various vibrant colours. Write out your child’s name or any word on a piece of paper. Make sure the letters are well-spaced out as the paint will bleed into the paper. Get your child to trace over what you have written with their fingers dipped in paint.

Theo TheSaurus is a little dino who loves words--the bigger the better! And he's determined to share that love with his new classmates in his new school, no matter that they don't understand him at first. But when a trip to the athenaeum (also known as the library) becomes a visit to the auditorium instead, and a suggestion to play conceal-and-search (or hide-and-seek) only earns him looks of confusion, Theo realizes that misinterpretations can actually just be plain confusing! It's only when his newfound friends find a way to show they care that Theo learns that sometimes, there are things more important than words.

In this sweet and funny book filled with bright art, a brand-new dino character, and a full glossary of big words at the end, readers have tons of fun--and learn some new words along the way! It's FANCY NANCY for the dino-loving set!

Small h has always lived with the other H’s in a city surrounded by walls that keep them safe. At least, that’s what the big H’s say. But one day, a hole in the wall reveals someone new on the other side. When little h and little i meet, they make a small word with big meaning: “hi!” The other H’s find out, though. They fill the hole. But it won’t be enough to keep these little letters apart–or twenty-four of their newest friends. Every Little Letter shows how even the smallest among us can make a big impact, and how a single act of friendship can inspire whole communities to come together. How do you tear down walls? With words, at first. Then brick by brick.
