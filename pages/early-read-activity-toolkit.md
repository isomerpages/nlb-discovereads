## About the Activity Toolkit

The Activity Toolkit is a teaching aide designed and curated by the National Library Board's Early Read librarians. It aims to help preschool educators as well as parents educate their children from N1/N2 to K1/K2 on essential reading and writing skills, which will continue to develop as they grow older. 

The toolkit was first introduced in 2016 and as years pass, our librarians have been working diligently to continually update and improve its contents. 

The toolkit comes with the following materials:
1.  Selected English and MTL Books
2.  English and MTL Lesson Plan Inserts for Guided Learning
3.  Booklets with Fun Activities to Supplement Learning

The toolkit nurtures your children by developing them according to the [Early Literacy Practices](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/diy-resources/preschool/preschool-main):
* [Play](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/earlylit-play)
* [Write](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/earlylit-write)
* [Talk](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/earlylit-talk)
* [Sing](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/earlylit-sing)
* [Read](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/earlylit-read)

We have created this page specifically for our preschool educators as a repository of all our current and past Activity Toolkits to download as they wish. 

As this is an **unlisted** page specifically for you, please do not **share the link outside of your organization** and **move or delete the files in the Google Drive folders**.
