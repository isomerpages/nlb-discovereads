## About the Activity Toolkit

The Activity Toolkit is a teaching aide designed and curated by the National Library Board's Early Read librarians. It aims to help preschool educators as well as parents educate their children from Nursery to Kindergarten on essential reading and writing skills, which will continue to develop as they grow older. 

The toolkit was first introduced in 2016 and as years pass, our librarians have been working diligently to continually update and improve its contents.

2.  Lesson Plan Inserts for Guided Learning
3.  Booklets with Fun Activities to Supplement Learning
