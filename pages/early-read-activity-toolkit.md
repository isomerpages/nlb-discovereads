## About the Activity Toolkit

The Activity Toolkit is a resource kit for preschool educators developed by the National Library Board. It includes a selection of books and activities chosen to help children develop pre-reading skills and an enjoyment of books and reading. 

The Activity Toolkit comes with the following materials:
1.	Selected English and MTL books
2.	English and MTL lesson plans 
3.	Activity Booklets to supplement learning

We have created this repository of our current and past Activity Toolkits. Preschool educators can download these resources for use at their centres.  The recommended activities are curated based on the  [Early Literacy Practices](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/diy-resources/preschool/preschool-main):

## Activity Toolkit Instructional Videos

As a way to ease our educators into using the Activity Toolkit, NLB's Early Read team has produced a series of videos to introduce the contents of the toolkit to educators and how they can be used to develop their students' literacy skills as well as their interest and proficiency in reading in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. 

**Why You Should Use the Activity Toolkit**

The Activity Toolkit is designed to complement preschool curriculum. Preschool educators have the flexibility to share these books at any point during their centres’ curriculum as there is no fixed format in the use of these materials.

The Activity Toolkit consists of theme-based lesson plans. Six of these themes are based on the pre-reading skills from Every Child Ready to Read Kit, developed by the American Public Library Association and Association for Library Service to Children. Other themes include Children’s Classics, Singapore Stories, Values & Character Building, Growing Up, Information Books and Storytelling. 

Teachers can use these stories to teach universal values, highlight social and emotional developmental milestones, and inculcate a sense of belonging.
