#### The Activity Toolkit is a set of activity sheets designed for parents and educators to supplement children's learning in N1/N2 as well as K1/K2. The toolkit centers around a selection of titles curated by our Early Read librarians along with the various activities that exemplify the [Early Literacy Practices](https://childrenandteens.nlb.gov.sg/diy-resources/preschool/preschool-main), which are Read, Write, Play, Talk and Sing. 

##### These sheets are printable for educational fun for your little ones!
